The department may establish the terms and conditions and fix the charges, rentals, and fees for the privileges or services that are reasonable and uniform for the same class of privilege or service. Charges, rentals, or fees authorized by this subsection may be fixed for the international airports by order of the commissioner or by negotiated or competitively offered contract. Notwithstanding AS 37.10.050(a), the fixing of charges, rentals, or fees as permitted under this subsection is not subject to the adoption of regulation provisions of AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act). The terms, conditions, charges, rentals, and fees shall be established with due regard to the property and improvements used and the expense of operation to the state. A charge, rental, or fee imposed on a person who is not a lessee or concessionaire of the airport may not have the effect of charging a percentage of the gross revenue of the person as a condition of on-site access to customers who use the airport facility unless the charge, rental, or fee was in existence before January 1, 2006, and this exception is not affected if the department amends, increases, or decreases a charge, rental, or fee that was in effect before January 1, 2006. Use of state land and buildings by the Alaska Wing, Civil Air Patrol and its squadrons shall be permitted without rental charges. If the department permits space in state-owned or state-controlled airports to be used as lounges for members of the United States armed forces, the Alaska National Guard, the Alaska Naval Militia, or the Alaska State Defense Force, and if the lounges are operated by persons exempt from taxation under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) (Internal Revenue Code), rent may not be charged for the use of the space. The department shall provide for public notice and an opportunity to comment before a charge, rental, or fee is fixed by order of the commissioner as permitted under this subsection. The public may not be deprived of its rightful, equal, and uniform use of the airport, air navigation facility, or a portion of them.\n(b) The department may by contract or other arrangement, upon a consideration fixed by it, grant to a qualified municipality or person for a reasonable period of time the privilege of operating, as agent of the state or otherwise, an airport owned or controlled by the state. A municipality or person granted that privilege may not operate the airport other than as a public airport or enter into a contract, lease, or other arrangement in connection with the operation that the department may not have undertaken under (a) or (c) - (e) of this section.\n(c) Notwithstanding the right of the public to rightful, equal, and uniform use under (a) of this section, before the expiration of a land lease, including the termination of a lease in holdover status, entered into under this section, the lessee may apply for a new lease, or for an extended term under the existing lease, for the same land. The commissioner shall approve the application for a new land lease or an extended term under this section without offering the land to other persons for leasing if\n(1) the lessee is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the existing or holdover lease; and\n(2) the continued use of the leasehold is consistent with written airport operation policies and is in the state's best interest.\n(d) A land lessee owns title to the permanent improvements that the lessee constructed or purchased during the term of the lease, unless the lease expressly provides that the state is the owner of the permanent improvements.\n(e) At the expiration, termination, or cancellation of a land lease entered into under this section,\n(1) a lessee who owns the improvements under (d) of this section shall continue to own the permanent improvements that the lessee constructed or purchased on a leasehold if the lessee is granted under (c) of this section a new lease or an extended term for the same land;\n(2) a lessee may sell the permanent improvements owned by the lessee to a succeeding lessee of the same land;\n(3) at the option of the lessee, the permanent improvements owned by the lessee may be sold by the state at public auction with the proceeds from the sale of the improvements going to the lessee, less administrative costs of the auction and obligations owed under the lease to the state; the successful bidder has the same right to enter into a new lease under (c) of this section without the department offering the land to other persons for leasing;\n(4) after notice by the department, the permanent improvements owned by the lessee shall be removed at the lessee's sole expense if\n(A) the permanent improvements do not comply with written airport operational policies or are not in the state's best interest;\n(B) the permanent improvements are not sold under (2) or (3) of this subsection; or\n(C) the department makes written findings that the permanent improvements are a hazard to the public health and safety;\n(5) title to the permanent improvements vests in the department if the state purchases or otherwise contracts for the ownership of the permanent improvements, or if the lessee abandons the permanent improvements.\n(f) The department shall require as a term of all aviation-related contracts, leases, and other arrangements for use or occupancy of an airport operated by the department, including the international airports, that the parties to the contract, lease, or other arrangement, including the department, shall be required to reimburse each other according to the principles of comparative fault for amounts paid others for personal injury and property damage. The apportionment of liability among the parties to an agreement under this subsection may not affect the rights of persons who are not parties to the agreement.\n(g) If the department determines that it is in the best interests of the state to require that persons holding aviation-related leases, permits, or concession contracts for use or occupancy of an airport operated by the department, including international airports, provide insurance coverage, the department shall develop and adopt by regulation guidelines for the types and limits of insurance coverage required for aviation-related leases, permits, or concession contracts. The department may authorize a variation from the coverage required by the regulation if the department finds in writing that the variation is necessary considering the best interests of the state and the unique circumstances underlying a specific aviation-related lease, permit, or concession contract.\n(h) For the privilege of occupying or using a state-owned facility on an airport, which facility is or will be acquired, constructed, equipped, installed, or improved with the proceeds of indebtedness, the payment of which, with approval of the commissioner, is or will be secured solely by proceeds from customer facility charges, the department may require all persons under contract to occupy or use all or a portion of the planned facility, and shall require occupants or users of all or a portion of the facility, to collect from their customers a uniform customer facility charge and remit the proceeds to (1) the department if the state on behalf of the department incurred the indebtedness; or (2) a trustee or another third party bound to use the proceeds for the principal, interest, reserves, and any other applicable requirements of the indebtedness documentation if the state on behalf of the department did not incur the indebtedness. The commissioner shall set the customer facility charge at an amount projected to generate proceeds sufficient to satisfy all requirements established by the indebtedness documentation, including payment of principal and interest on the indebtedness, maintenance of any reserves, and satisfaction of any other requirement of the indebtedness documentation. The commissioner shall periodically adjust the amount of the customer facility charge to reflect changes in the amounts necessary to pay the principal of and interest on the indebtedness, to maintain any required reserves, and to satisfy all other requirements established by the indebtedness documentation and to reflect changes in the number of occupants, users, or customers of the facility. The proceeds of the customer facility charge are not revenue of the state securing any other indebtedness. The commissioner may impose charges authorized by this subsection for the international airports by order or by negotiated or competitively offered contract. The department shall provide for public notice and an opportunity to comment before a charge is set by order of the commissioner under this subsection. Notwithstanding AS 37.10.050(a), the setting of charges under this subsection is not subject to the adoption of regulation provisions of AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act).\n(i) In addition to requiring collection of a customer facility charge to be applied as described in (h) of this section, the department may require occupants or users of, or persons under contract to occupy or use, all or a portion of a state-owned facility on an airport, which facility is or will be acquired, constructed, equipped, installed, or improved with the proceeds of indebtedness, the payment of which is secured solely by proceeds of a customer facility charge, to collect from their customers a uniform customer facility maintenance charge and to remit the proceeds to (1) the department if the state on behalf of the department incurred the indebtedness; or (2) a trustee or another third party if the state on behalf of the department did not incur the indebtedness. The commissioner shall set the customer facility maintenance charge at an amount projected to generate proceeds sufficient to pay some or all, as determined by the commissioner, of the costs, fees, and expenses required to operate and maintain the facility, including costs of insurance and maintenance of reserves for the facility. The commissioner shall periodically adjust the amount of the customer facility maintenance charge to reflect changes in costs, fees, and expenses to operate and maintain the facility, including costs of insurance and maintenance of reserves for the facility and to reflect changes in the number of occupants, users, or customers of the facility. If the proceeds of the customer facility maintenance charge are remitted to a trustee or another third party as set out in this subsection, the proceeds of the customer facility maintenance charge are not, unless otherwise contractually required, revenue of the state securing any indebtedness. The commissioner may impose charges authorized by this subsection for the international airports by order or by negotiated or competitively offered contract. The department shall provide for public notice and an opportunity to comment before a charge is set by order of the commissioner under this subsection. Notwithstanding AS 37.10.050(a), the setting of charges under this subsection is not subject to the adoption of regulation provisions of AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act)."}

If the owner of the nonconforming structure or tree neglects or refuses to comply with the order within 10 days after notice, the department may proceed to have the object lowered, removed, reconstructed, or equipped, and the cost and expense is a lien upon the object and the land on which it is located. Unless the account is paid within 90 days from the service of notice on the agent or owner of the object or land, the sum bears interest at the rate of eight percent a year until paid, and shall be collected by foreclosure in the manner provided for the foreclosure of mortgages."}

If the local governing body recommends conditions, the board shall impose the recommended conditions unless the board finds that the recommended conditions are arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. If a condition recommended by a local governing body is imposed on a licensee, the local governing body shall assume responsibility for monitoring compliance with the condition, except as otherwise provided by the board.\n(d) In addition to the right to protest under (a) of this section, a local governing body may notify the board that the local governing body has determined that a licensee has violated a provision of this title or a condition imposed on the licensee by the board. Unless the board finds that the local governing body's determination is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, the board shall prepare the determination as an accusation against the licensee under AS 44.62.360 and conduct proceedings to resolve the matter as described under AS 04.11.510(c).\n(e) [Effective January 1, 2024] If the location or proposed location of a license is within the boundaries of more than one local government, each local governing body may protest the issuance, renewal, relocation, or transfer of a license."}

The specified day may not be less than 60 days from the date of the first publication of the notice.\n(c) A safe deposit box whose contents have not been removed within 30 days after demand shall be opened. The department shall retain the contents of the box and the other unclaimed property held by the trust company as bailee until the conclusion of the liquidation proceedings. At the conclusion of the liquidation proceedings under this section, the property held by the department under this subsection is considered abandoned, and the department shall deliver the property to the Department of Revenue under AS 34.45.110 - 34.45.780.\n(d) Within six months after the last day specified in the notice for the filing of claims, or within a longer period if allowed by the superior court, the department shall\n(1) reject a claim that it determines to be invalid;\n(2) determine the amount, if any, owing to each known creditor or depositor and the priority class of the person's claim under this chapter;\n(3) prepare a schedule of its determinations for filing in the superior court;\n(4) publish a notice in a newspaper once each week for three successive weeks, of the times and places where the schedule of determinations will be available for inspection and the date when the department will file its schedule in court; the date may not be sooner than 30 days after the first publication.\n(e) Within 30 days after the filing with the superior court of the department's schedule under (d)(3) of this section, a creditor, depositor, or stockholder may file with the court an objection to a determination.

If the court sustains an objection, the court shall direct that the schedule be modified appropriately.\n(f) After filing its schedule, the department may make partial distribution to the holders of the claims that are undisputed or are allowed by the court if an adequate reserve is established for the payment of disputed claims.

Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall proceed as provided in AS 06.26.760 - 06.26.800.\n(m) An order issued by the court under a petition filed under (l) of this section may only declare the trust company's fiduciary operations in this state have been properly wound up and may not declare the trust company is dissolved.

A temporary order may be entered only after notice and opportunity for a hearing, unless the department determines that notice and hearing before entry would be impracticable or contrary to the public interest. A temporary order becomes effective on service on the respondent and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the department or a court of competent jurisdiction, remains effective and enforceable pending the completion of the cease and desist proceedings."}

Unless a pilot organization has an agreement with the master, owner, operator, or agent of a master, owner, or operator, of a vessel that sets rates for the provision of a pilotage service, the pilot organization may not charge a rate for the provision of the pilotage service to the vessel that is different from the rate adopted or established under this section.\n(b) If a pilot organization intends to adopt a new or revised rate for the provision of a pilotage service, the pilot organization shall, before October 15, send a notice of intent to adopt a rate for provision of the pilotage service to the board and to all registered agents and publish the notice on at least three days during a period of 14 consecutive days in a newspaper of general circulation in the state. The notice of intent to adopt a rate must include a copy of the proposed rate and the name and mailing address of the pilot organization that intends to adopt the rate. If no objection to the proposed rate is filed with the board under (c) of this section, the rate takes effect on January 1 of the year following the year in which the notice of the intent to adopt the rate was filed with the board.\n(c) The master, owner, operator, or agent of the master, owner, or operator, of a vessel required to employ a pilot under this chapter may object to the proposed rate for a specific pilotage service by filing a written notice of objection, containing the grounds for the objection and relevant evidence demonstrating that the rate is not reasonable, with the board within 60 days after the final date of publication of the proposed rate in a newspaper of general circulation. The pilot organization that proposed the rate has until 15 days after the close of the period for filing objections to the proposed rate to provide its written response to the notice of objection and relevant evidence demonstrating that the rate is reasonable. If the pilot organization does not respond to the notice of objection by the close of the 15-day period for response to the objection, the board may not take action on the proposed rate and the proposed rate does not take effect. If the pilot organization does respond to the notice of objection before the close of the response period, the board shall hold a hearing to determine whether the proposed rate is reasonable. If the board finds that the proposed rate is reasonable, the rate is approved and takes effect retroactive to January 1 of the calendar year in which the rate would have taken effect under (b) of this section if no objection had been filed. If the board finds that the proposed rate is not reasonable, the proposed rate is disapproved and does not take effect. In determining what constitutes a reasonable rate, the board shall consider the following factors:\n(1) current and historical rates charged for comparable pilotage services;\n(2) the actual time aboard the vessel, time engaged in preparing to provide the pilotage services, seasonal and weather conditions, and risks;\n(3) the reasonable expenses incurred in providing the pilotage services such as dispatch, transportation, overhead, and other associated expenses;\n(4) the financial effect of pilotage expenses on the owner of the vessel, except that this factor shall only be considered if the owner provides all financial information that the board determines is necessary to determine the financial effect;\n(5) the number of vessels and volume of pilotage services at issue in the dispute and the number of members of the pilot organization;\n(6) the effect of the determination on the income of affected pilots relative to prior years, taking into account changes in vessel tonnage and vessel traffic in the pilotage region from year-to-year;\n(7) prior determinations under this subsection; and\n(8) other factors the board considers relevant.\n(d) Pending the review and approval of the proposed rate for a specific pilotage service by the board under (c) of this section, the current rate then in effect for that pilotage service remains in effect until the board approves the proposed rate. If the proposed rate approved by the board is greater than the current rate, then the master, owner, or operator of the vessel or the vessel is liable for the payment of the additional amount owed for the provision of pilotage services during the pendency of the review by the board due to retroactive application of the approved rate under (c) of this section. If the proposed rate is less than the current rate, then the pilot organization is liable to the master, owner, or operator of the vessel or the vessel for reimbursement of the amount overpaid for the provision of pilotage services during the pendency of the review by the board due to the retroactive application of the approved rate under (c) of this section.\n(e) If the board finds under (c) of this section that a proposed rate is not reasonable, the pilot organization may propose a new rate for that pilotage service within 60 days after the decision of the board is issued by sending a notice of intent to adopt a rate for provision of the pilotage service to the board and to all registered agents and publishing the notice on at least three days during a period of 14 consecutive days in a newspaper of general circulation in the state. The notice of intent to adopt a rate must include a copy of the proposed rate and the name and mailing address of the pilot organization that intends to adopt the rate. If a timely objection to the proposed rate is not filed with the board under (c) of this section, the rate takes effect retroactive to January 1 of the same calendar year in which the initial rate proposed under (b) of this section would have taken effect if no objection had been filed. If a timely objection is filed, the provisions of (c) and (d) of this section apply to the proposed rate.\n(f) The board shall provide a schedule of rates adopted under this section to agents registered under AS 08.62.187."}

The court may issue orders as necessary, including directing the parties to have the information relevant to the amount of punitive damages to be determined under (c)(3) or (6) of this section available for production immediately at the close of the initial trial in order to minimize the delay between the initial trial and the separate proceeding to determine the amount of punitive damages.\n(f) Except as provided in (g) and (h) of this section, an award of punitive damages may not exceed the greater of\n(1) three times the amount of compensatory damages awarded to the plaintiff in the action; or\n(2) the sum of $500,000.\n(g) Except as provided in (h) of this section, if the fact finder determines that the conduct proven under (b) of this section was motivated by financial gain and the adverse consequences of the conduct were actually known by the defendant or the person responsible for making policy decisions on behalf of the defendant, it may award an amount of punitive damages not to exceed the greatest of\n(1) four times the amount of compensatory damages awarded to the plaintiff in the action;\n(2) four times the aggregate amount of financial gain that the defendant received as a result of the defendant's misconduct; or\n(3) the sum of $7,000,000.\n(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in an action against an employer to recover damages for an unlawful employment practice prohibited by AS 18.80.220, the amount of punitive damages awarded by the court or jury may not exceed\n(1) $200,000 if the employer has less than 100 employees in this state;\n(2) $300,000 if the employer has 100 or more but less than 200 employees in this state;\n(3) $400,000 if the employer has 200 or more but less than 500 employees in this state; and\n(4) $500,000 if the employer has 500 or more employees in this state.\n(i) Subsection (h) of this section may not be construed to allow an award of punitive damages against the state or a person immune under another provision of law. In (h) of this section, \u201cemployees\u201d means persons employed in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year.\n(j) If a person receives an award of punitive damages, the court shall require that 50 percent of the award be deposited into the general fund of the state. This subsection does not grant the state the right to file or join a civil action to recover punitive damages.\n(k) In a civil action in which an employer is determined to be vicariously liable for the act or omission of an employee, punitive damages may not be awarded against the employer under principles of vicarious liability unless (1) the employer or the employer's managerial agent (A) authorized the act or omission and the manner in which the act was performed or omission occurred; or (B) ratified or approved the act or omission after the act or omission occurred; or (2) the employee (A) was unfit to perform the act or avoid the omission and the employer or the employer's managerial agent acted recklessly in employing or retaining the employee; or (B) was employed in a managerial capacity and was acting within the scope of employment. In this subsection, \u201cmanagerial agent\u201d means a management level employee with the stature and authority to exercise control, discretion, and independent judgment over a certain area of the employer's business and with some power to set policy for the employer."}

The court may not require security to be posted if an authorized insurer, as defined in AS 21.97.900, acknowledges to the court its obligation to discharge the judgment.\n(f) A judgment ordering payment of future damages by periodic payment shall specify the recipient, the dollar amount of the payments, the interval between payments, and the number of payments or the period of time over which payments shall be made. Payments may be modified only in the event of the death of the judgment creditor, in which case payments may not be reduced or terminated, but shall be paid to persons to whom the judgment creditor owed a duty of support, as provided by law, immediately before death. In the event the judgment creditor owed no duty of support to dependents at the time of the judgment creditor's death, the money remaining shall be distributed in accordance with a will of the deceased judgment creditor accepted into probate or under the intestate laws of the state if the deceased had no will.\n(g) If the court finds that the judgment debtor has exhibited a continuing pattern of failing to make payments required under (d) of this section, the court shall, in addition to the required periodic payments, order the judgment debtor to pay the judgment creditor any damages caused by the failure to make periodic payments, including costs and attorney fees."}
