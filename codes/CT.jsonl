Failure to comply with a request to so inspect or copy such public record within the applicable number of business days shall be deemed to be a denial.\n(b) (1) Any person denied the right to inspect or copy records under section 1-210 or wrongfully denied the right to attend any meeting of a public agency or denied any other right conferred by the Freedom of Information Act may appeal therefrom to the Freedom of Information Commission, by filing a notice of appeal with said commission. A notice of appeal shall be filed not later than thirty days after such denial, except in the case of an unnoticed or secret meeting, in which case the appeal shall be filed not later than thirty days after the person filing the appeal receives actual or constructive notice that such meeting was held. For purposes of this subsection, such notice of appeal shall be deemed to be filed on the date it is received by said commission or on the date it is postmarked, if received more than thirty days after the date of the denial from which such appeal is taken. Upon receipt of such notice, the commission shall serve upon all parties, by certified or registered mail or by electronic transmission, a copy of such notice together with any other notice or order of such commission. In the case of the denial of a request to inspect or copy records contained in a public employee's personnel or medical file or similar file under subsection (c) of section 1-214, the commission shall include with its notice or order an order requiring the public agency to notify any employee whose records are the subject of an appeal, and the employee's collective bargaining representative, if any, of the commission's proceedings and, if any such employee or collective bargaining representative has filed an objection under said subsection (c), the agency shall provide the required notice to such employee and collective bargaining representative by certified mail, return receipt requested, by electronic transmission or by hand delivery with a signed receipt. A public employee whose personnel or medical file or similar file is the subject of an appeal under this subsection may intervene as a party in the proceedings on the matter before the commission. Said commission shall, after due notice to the parties, hear and decide the appeal within one year after the filing of the notice of appeal. The commission shall adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54, establishing criteria for those appeals which shall be privileged in their assignment for hearing. Any such appeal shall be heard not later than thirty days after receipt of a notice of appeal and decided not later than sixty days after the hearing. If a notice of appeal concerns an announced agency decision to meet in executive session or an ongoing agency practice of meeting in executive sessions, for a stated purpose, the commission or a member or members of the commission designated by its chairperson shall serve notice upon the parties in accordance with this section and hold a preliminary hearing on the appeal not later than seventy-two hours after receipt of the notice, provided such notice shall be given to the parties at least forty-eight hours prior to such hearing. During such preliminary hearing, the commission shall take evidence and receive testimony from the parties. If after the preliminary hearing the commission finds probable cause to believe that the agency decision or practice is in violation of sections 1-200 and 1-225, the agency shall not meet in executive session for such purpose until the commission decides the appeal. If probable cause is found by the commission, it shall conduct a final hearing on the appeal and render its decision not later than five days after the completion of the preliminary hearing. Such decision shall specify the commission's findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n(2) In any appeal to the Freedom of Information Commission under subdivision (1) of this subsection or subsection (c) of this section, the commission may confirm the action of the agency or order the agency to provide relief that the commission, in its discretion, believes appropriate to rectify the denial of any right conferred by the Freedom of Information Act. The commission may declare null and void any action taken at any meeting which a person was denied the right to attend and may require the production or copying of any public record. In addition, upon the finding that a denial of any right created by the Freedom of Information Act was without reasonable grounds and after the custodian or other official directly responsible for the denial has been given an opportunity to be heard at a hearing conducted in accordance with sections 4-176e to 4-184, inclusive, the commission may, in its discretion, impose against the custodian or other official a civil penalty of not less than twenty dollars nor more than one thousand dollars. If the commission finds that a person has taken an appeal under this subsection frivolously, without reasonable grounds and solely for the purpose of harassing the agency from which the appeal has been taken, after such person has been given an opportunity to be heard at a hearing conducted in accordance with sections 4-176e to 4-184, inclusive, the commission may, in its discretion, impose against that person a civil penalty of not less than twenty dollars nor more than one thousand dollars. The commission shall notify a person of a penalty levied against him pursuant to this subsection by written notice sent by certified or registered mail or electronic transmission. If a person fails to pay the penalty within thirty days of receiving such notice, the Superior Court shall, on application of the commission, issue an order requiring the person to pay the penalty imposed. If the executive director of the commission has reason to believe an appeal under subdivision (1) of this subsection or subsection (c) of this section (A) presents a claim beyond the commission's jurisdiction; (B) would perpetrate an injustice; or (C) would constitute an abuse of the commission's administrative process, the executive director shall not schedule the appeal for hearing without first seeking and obtaining leave of the commission. The commission shall provide due notice to the parties and review affidavits and written argument that the parties may submit and grant or deny such leave summarily at its next regular meeting. The commission shall grant such leave unless it finds that the appeal: (i) Does not present a claim within the commission's jurisdiction; (ii) would perpetrate an injustice; or (iii) would constitute an abuse of the commission's administrative process. Any party aggrieved by the commission's denial of such leave may apply to the superior court for the judicial district of New Britain, within fifteen days of the commission meeting at which such leave was denied, for an order requiring the commission to hear such appeal.\n(3) In making the findings and determination under subdivision (2) of this subsection the commission shall consider the nature of any injustice or abuse of administrative process, including but not limited to: (A) The nature, content, language or subject matter of the request or the appeal, including, among other factors, whether the request or appeal is repetitious or cumulative; (B) the nature, content, language or subject matter of prior or contemporaneous requests or appeals by the person making the request or taking the appeal; (C) the nature, content, language or subject matter of other verbal and written communications to any agency or any official of any agency from the person making the request or taking the appeal; (D) any history of nonappearance at commission proceedings or disruption of the commission's administrative process, including, but not limited to, delaying commission proceedings; and (E) the refusal to participate in settlement conferences conducted by a commission ombudsman in accordance with the commission's regulations.\n(4) Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the contrary, in the case of an appeal to the commission of a denial by a public agency, the commission may, upon motion of such agency, confirm the action of the agency and dismiss the appeal without a hearing if it finds, after examining the notice of appeal and construing all allegations most favorably to the appellant, that (A) the agency has not violated the Freedom of Information Act, or (B) the agency has committed a technical violation of the Freedom of Information Act that constitutes a harmless error that does not infringe the appellant's rights under said act.\n(5) Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection, a public agency may petition the commission for relief from a requester that the public agency alleges is a vexatious requester. Such petition shall be sworn under penalty of false statement, as provided in section 53a-157b, and shall detail the conduct which the agency alleges demonstrates a vexatious history of requests, including, but not limited to: (A) The number of requests filed and the total number of pending requests; (B) the scope of the requests; (C) the nature, content, language or subject matter of the requests; (D) the nature, content, language or subject matter of other oral and written communications to the agency from the requester; and (E) a pattern of conduct that amounts to an abuse of the right to access information under the Freedom of Information Act or an interference with the operation of the agency. Upon receipt of such petition, the executive director of the commission shall review the petition and determine whether it warrants a hearing. If the executive director determines that a hearing is not warranted, the executive director shall recommend that the commission deny the petition without a hearing. The commission shall vote at its next regular meeting after such recommendation to accept or reject such recommendation and, after such meeting, shall issue a written explanation of the reasons for such acceptance or rejection. If the executive director determines that a hearing is warranted, the commission shall serve upon all parties, by certified or registered mail or electronic transmission, a copy of such petition together with any other notice or order of the commission. The commission shall, after due notice to the parties, hear and either grant or deny the petition within one year after its filing. Upon a grant of such petition, the commission may provide appropriate relief commensurate with the vexatious conduct, including, but not limited to, an order that the agency need not comply with future requests from the vexatious requester for a specified period of time, but not to exceed one year. Any party aggrieved by the commission's granting of such petition may apply to the superior court for the judicial district of New Britain, within fifteen days of the commission meeting at which such petition was granted, for an order reversing the commission's decision.\n(c) Any person who does not receive proper notice of any meeting of a public agency in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act may appeal under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section. A public agency of the state shall be presumed to have given timely and proper notice of any meeting as provided for in said Freedom of Information Act if notice is given in the Connecticut Law Journal or a Legislative Bulletin. A public agency of a political subdivision shall be presumed to have given proper notice of any meeting, if a notice is timely sent under the provisions of said Freedom of Information Act by (1) first-class mail to the address, or (2) electronic transmission to the information processing system, as defined in section 1-267, indicated in the request of the person requesting the same. If such commission determines that notice was improper, it may, in its sound discretion, declare any or all actions taken at such meeting null and void.\n(d) Any party aggrieved by the decision of said commission may appeal therefrom, in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4-183, in any such appeal of a decision of the commission, the court may conduct an in camera review of the original or a certified copy of the records which are at issue in the appeal but were not included in the record of the commission's proceedings, admit the records into evidence and order the records to be sealed or inspected on such terms as the court deems fair and appropriate, during the appeal. The commission shall have standing to defend, prosecute or otherwise participate in any appeal of any of its decisions and to take an appeal from any judicial decision overturning or modifying a decision of the commission. If aggrievement is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the commission taking any such appeal, the commission shall be deemed to be aggrieved. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3-125, legal counsel employed or retained by said commission shall represent said commission in all such appeals and in any other litigation affecting said commission. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c) of section 4-183 and section 52-64, all process shall be served upon said commission at its office. Any appeal taken pursuant to this section shall be privileged in respect to its assignment for trial over all other actions except writs of habeas corpus and actions brought by or on behalf of the state, including informations on the relation of private individuals. Nothing in this section shall deprive any party of any rights he may have had at common law prior to January 1, 1958. If the court finds that any appeal taken pursuant to this section or section 4-183 is frivolous or taken solely for the purpose of delay, it shall order the party responsible therefor to pay to the party injured by such frivolous or dilatory appeal costs or attorney's fees of not more than one thousand dollars. Such order shall be in addition to any other remedy or disciplinary action required or permitted by statute or by rules of court.\n(e) Within sixty days after the filing of a notice of appeal alleging violation of any right conferred by the Freedom of Information Act concerning records of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection relating to the state's hazardous waste program under sections 22a-448 to 22a-454, inclusive, the Freedom of Information Commission shall, after notice to the parties, hear and decide the appeal. Failure by the commission to hear and decide the appeal within such sixty-day period shall constitute a final decision denying such appeal for purposes of this section and section 4-183. On appeal, the court may, in addition to any other powers conferred by law, order the disclosure of any such records withheld in violation of the Freedom of Information Act and may assess against the state reasonable attorney's fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in an appeal in which the complainant has prevailed against the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.\n(P.A. 75-342, S. 14; P.A. 76-435, S. 25, 82; P.A. 77-403; 77-603, S. 2, 125; 77-609, S. 6, 8; P.A. 78-331, S. 57, 58; P.A. 81-431, S. 2, 3; P.A. 83-129, S. 1, 2; 83-587, S. 69, 96; June Sp.

If such bill does not take effect on the first day of the fiscal year, the estimate shall also indicate the estimated cost to local governments for the next following fiscal year. If a bill is amended by the report of a committee on conference in such a manner as to result in a cost to local governments, the Office of Fiscal Analysis shall append an estimate of such cost to the report before the report is made to either house of the General Assembly.\n(d) On and after January 1, 1985, (1) any bill reported by a joint standing committee of the General Assembly which may create or enlarge a state mandate to local governments, as defined in subsection (a) of this section, shall be referred by such committee to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to appropriations and the budgets of state agencies, unless such reference is dispensed with by a vote of at least two-thirds of each house of the General Assembly, and (2) any bill amended by either house of the General Assembly or by the report of a committee on conference in such a manner as to create or enlarge a state mandate shall be referred to said committee, unless such reference is dispensed with by a vote of at least two-thirds of each house of the General Assembly.

In the investment of the state's trust funds the Treasurer shall consider the implications of any particular investment in relation to the foreign policy and national interests of the United States.\n(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in the general statutes or elsewhere to the contrary, the Treasurer may invest as much of the state's trust funds as are not required for current disbursements in Connecticut mortgage pass-through certificates. As used in this section, \u201cConnecticut mortgage pass-through certificate\u201d means (1) a certificate evidencing ownership of an undivided interest in a pool of mortgage loans, each of which is secured by a first mortgage on real property located in this state improved by one-to-four-family residential dwellings or units, where such mortgage loans are assigned to a trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state, as trustee for the benefit of the holders of such certificates, or (2) any Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation pass-through certificate or Federal National Mortgage Association securities backed by mortgage loans, each of which is secured by a first mortgage on real property located in this state improved by one-to-four-family residential dwellings or units; provided such mortgage loans are originated by any bank, trust company, national banking association, savings bank, federal mutual savings bank, savings and loan association, federal savings and loan association, credit union, or federal credit union authorized to do business in this state or by any lender authorized to do business in this state and approved by the federal Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for participation in any mortgage insurance program under the National Housing Act. In exercising his discretion to invest the state's trust funds in Connecticut mortgage pass-through certificates and in considering the yield on such investments, the Treasurer shall give preference to pools of mortgage loans which contain loans to persons who at the time of mortgage application are contributors to state pension and retirement funds included among the trust funds defined in section 3-13c or who have been past contributors to such funds and who continue to maintain a financial interest therein, and may consider furtherance of the public policy of increasing the amount of reasonably priced mortgage loans available to state residents. Nothing in this section shall prevent the Treasurer from investing state trust funds in mortgage pass-through certificates other than Connecticut mortgage pass-through certificates.\n(c) Except in the event of an express repeal of this subsection, no pool of mortgage loans, the ownership of which is evidenced by Connecticut mortgage pass-through certificates, shall be subject to any tax imposed by the state if all of the outstanding Connecticut mortgage pass-through certificates respecting such pool were at any time owned by or on behalf of any one or more of the state's trust funds.\n(d) Notwithstanding any other provision in the general statutes or elsewhere to the contrary, the Treasurer may enter into contracts with any life insurance company authorized to do business in Connecticut under which any amounts held in the state's trust funds may be used to purchase pension funding contracts and contracts providing for participation in separate accounts or under which funds become a part of the general account of any such life insurance company.\n(e) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, neither the Treasurer, the Deputy Treasurer nor any acting Treasurer shall make a private equity or real estate investment without the approval of the Investment Advisory Council, for the balance of the Treasurer's term of office, on or after any of the following events: (1) The defeat of the Treasurer (A) in a ballot for the party nomination for Treasurer at a convention where said Treasurer was a candidate for nomination, (B) in a primary for nomination for said office where said Treasurer was a candidate for nomination, or (C) upon the completion of a recanvass of the returns from such primary under section 9-445 or 9-446, whichever is later, (2) the defeat of the Treasurer (A) in the election for said office or (B) upon the completion of a recanvass of the returns from such election under section 9-311, 9-311a or 9-311b, or (3) the resignation of the Treasurer.\n(P.A. 73-594, S. 7, 12; P.A. 74-49, S. 1, 2; P.A. 80-431, S. 2, 4; P.A. 81-343, S. 2, 7; P.A. 86-29, S. 1, 3; P.A. 92-69, S. 4, 5; P.A. 95-120, S. 1, 2; June 18 Sp.

(a) to permit Treasurer to invest no more than 55%, instead of 50% of a trust fund in common stock, except under specified conditions, for a six-month period of time, effective July 1, 1995; (Revisor's note: Section 8 of June 18 Sp.

No such resolution shall be so adopted by the State Bond Commission unless it finds that:\n(i) There has been filed with it (I) any human services facility colocation statement to be filed with the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, if so requested by the secretary, pursuant to section 4b-23; (II) a statement from the Commissioner of Agriculture pursuant to section 22-6, for projects which would convert twenty-five or more acres of prime farmland to a nonagricultural use; (III) prior to the meeting at which such resolution is to be considered, any capital development impact statement required to be filed with the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management; (IV) a statement as to the full cost of the project or purpose when completed and the estimated operating cost for any structure, equipment or facility to be constructed or acquired; and (V) such requests and such other documents as it or such bond act requires, provided no resolution with respect to any school building project financed pursuant to section 10-287d or any interest subsidy financed pursuant to section 10-292k shall require the filing of any statements pursuant to this clause and provided further any resolution requiring a capital impact statement shall be deemed not properly before the State Bond Commission until such capital development impact statement is filed; and\n(ii) Such authorization does not exceed the limit specified under subdivision (2) of subsection (d) of this section.\n(B) Any such resolution so adopted by the State Bond Commission shall recite the bond act under which said commission is empowered to authorize such bonds and the filing of all requests and other documents, if any, required by it or such bond act, and shall state the principal amount of the bonds authorized and a description of the purpose or project for which such bonds are authorized. Such description shall be sufficient if made merely by reference to a numbered subsection, subdivision or other applicable section of such bond act.\n(2) The agenda of each meeting shall be made available to the members of the commission not later than five business days prior to the meeting at which such agenda is to be considered. The day of the meeting shall count as one of the business days. The agenda of each meeting, or any supporting documents included with such agenda, shall include a reference to the statute or public or special act which is the source of any funds to be used for any project on such agenda, including any contingency funds and any reuse or reallocation of funds previously approved for any other use or project, and a notation of the outside source from which any funds for any such project were received, if any.\n(3) Upon adoption of a resolution, the principal amount of the bonds authorized therein for such purpose or project shall be deemed to be an appropriation and allocation of such amount for such purpose or project, respectively, and subject to approval by the Governor of allotment thereof and to any authorization for such project or purpose that may otherwise be required, contracts may be awarded and obligations incurred with respect to any such project or purpose in amounts not in the aggregate exceeding such authorized principal amount, notwithstanding that such contracts and obligations may at a particular time exceed the amount of the proceeds from the sale of such bonds theretofore received by the state. In any such resolution so adopted, the State Bond Commission may include provision for the date or dates of such bonds, the maturity of such bonds and, notwithstanding the provisions of any bond act taking effect prior to July 1, 1973, provision for either serial or term, sinking fund or other reserve fund requirements, if any, due dates of the interest thereon, the form of such bonds, the denominations and designation of such bonds, registration, conversion and transfer privileges and the terms of redemption with or without premium and the date and manner of sale of such bonds, provisions for the consolidation of such bonds with other bonds including refunding bonds for the purpose of sale as provided in subsection (h) of this section, limitations with respect to the interest rate or rates on such bonds, provisions for receipt and deposit or investment of the good faith deposit pending delivery of such bonds and such other terms and conditions of such bonds and of the issuance and sale thereof as the State Bond Commission may determine to be in the best interest of the state, provided the State Bond Commission may delegate to the Treasurer all or any part of the foregoing powers in which event the Treasurer shall exercise such powers until the State Bond Commission, by adoption of a resolution prior to exercise of such powers by the Treasurer shall elect to reassume the same. Such powers shall be exercised from time to time in such manner as the Treasurer shall determine to be in the best interests of the state and the Treasurer shall file a certificate of determination setting forth the details thereof with the secretary of the State Bond Commission on or before the date of delivery of such bonds, the details of which were determined by the Treasurer in accordance with such delegation.\n(4) The State Bond Commission may authorize the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development to defer payments of interest or principal, or a portion thereof, in the case of a troubled loan, as defined in subdivision (1) of subsection (e) of section 8-37x, made by the commissioner under any provision of the general statutes.\n(h) Notwithstanding any general statute, public act or special act of the General Assembly enacted prior to or after March 20, 1973, bonds or portions thereof, including refunding bonds authorized by any general statute, public act or special act of the General Assembly enacted prior to or after said date to be issued by the commission or by the Treasurer may be consolidated for the purpose of sale and issued, sold, printed and delivered as a single bond issue, provided, if bonds authorized under two or more bond acts are issued as a single bond issue or if bonds authorized under one or more bond acts together with refunding bonds are issued as a single bond issue, a separate maturity schedule or sinking fund requirements, if any, for such bonds or portions thereof authorized under each bond act and for the refunding bonds shall be established and filed with the secretary of the State Bond Commission on or before the date of delivery of such bonds.\n(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or of any general statute, public act or special act of the General Assembly enacted prior to or after March 20, 1973, whenever the Treasurer finds that it is in the best interests of the state to refund bonds issued pursuant to this section or pursuant to any other general statute, public act or special act of the General Assembly enacted prior to or after said date the maturity date of which has not yet occurred, and whether such bonds to be refunded are or are not subject to redemption prior to maturity, refunding bonds of the state may be issued for the purpose of purchasing, paying, funding or refunding such bonds and the interest payable thereon in advance of their maturity, or, if subject to redemption, at such redemption date or dates as provided in such bonds, at maturity or on such date or dates as determined by the Treasurer. No such refunding bonds shall be issued unless they are part of an issue described in a bond determination made and signed by the Treasurer in accordance with and pursuant to this subsection of which a copy has been filed with the secretary of the Bond Commission prior to delivery of such refunding bonds and such determination (A) sets forth the maturities of the bonds, including any refunding bonds, and the interest installments thereof, to be paid from the proceeds of the refunding bonds and (B) includes a certification of the Treasurer that the state reasonably expects as of the date of the certification to achieve, as a result of the sale of such refunding bonds and the investment and application of the proceeds of such sale, net debt service savings. Upon the issuance of any refunding bonds the proceeds from the sale thereof shall be deemed to have been appropriated and pledged for and shall be used and applied to the purchase, redemption or payment of the bonds to be so refunded including the payment of any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue thereon to the date of purchase, redemption or payment of such bonds at or prior to the maturity of such bonds as set forth in the bond determination, the refunding bonds authorized and issued pursuant to this subsection shall be general obligations of the state and the full faith and credit of the state are pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on said bonds as the same become due, and accordingly as part of the contract of the state with the holders of said bonds, appropriation of all amounts necessary for punctual payment of such principal, including any amount of a mandatory sinking fund requirement as provided in such contract, and interest is hereby made, and the Treasurer shall pay such amounts as the same become due.

Except as may be provided in the bond determination authorizing refunding bonds pursuant to this subsection, net earnings of investments of proceeds of such refunding bonds not needed for the purpose for which such refunding bonds were authorized shall be deposited in the General Fund. In any such bond determination of the Treasurer authorizing refunding bonds pursuant to this subsection, said Treasurer may include provision for the date or dates of such refunding bonds, the principal amount of such refunding bonds, the maturity date or dates of such refunding bonds and provision relating to serial or term bonds and sinking or other reserve fund requirements, if any, the establishment and terms of any trust or trusts held by a trustee or by the Treasurer pursuant to this subsection, due dates of the interest on such refunding bonds, the form thereof, including execution and issuance to the purchasers, pending preparation of definitive refunding bonds, of temporary bonds without coupons exchangeable for the definitive bonds when prepared, executed and ready for delivery, the denominations and designation of such refunding bonds, registration, conversion and transfer privileges and the terms of redemption with or without premium, the date and manner of sale of such refunding bonds, either public or private, at such price or prices as the Treasurer may determine, provisions for the consolidation of such refunding bonds with other bonds for the purpose of sale as provided in subsection (h) hereof, limitations with respect to the interest rate or rates of such refunding bonds, provisions for receipt and deposit or investment of the good faith deposit pending delivery of such refunding bonds and such other terms and conditions of such refunding bonds and of the issuance and sale thereof and the investment of the proceeds thereof as the Treasurer may determine to be in the best interests of the state. For the purposes of this subsection, \u201crefunding bonds\u201d means bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness including commercial paper and shall be deemed to include any of those agreements authorized by section 3-20a, to the extent that the Treasurer determines that the execution thereof is appropriate or necessary to satisfy the refunding requirements of this subsection.\n(j) The Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management shall be the secretary of the State Bond Commission and shall be responsible for keeping complete records of the commission, including minutes certified by him of any meeting showing the adoption of any resolution by the commission and other actions taken by and documents filed with the commission, and such records shall be the official records of the proceedings of said commission and shall be maintained in the office of the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and open for public inspection. Meetings of the State Bond Commission shall be called upon such notice as may be determined by the State Bond Commission and may be open to the public.\n(k) Bonds and refunding bonds shall be signed in the name of the state by the manual or facsimile signatures of at least two of the following: (1) The Governor, (2) the Treasurer or the Deputy Treasurer appointed pursuant to section 3-12, and (3) the Comptroller. At least one of such signatures or the signature of an authenticating agent, certifying agent, registrar or transfer agent shall be a manual signature. Such bonds and refunding bonds may be issued notwithstanding that any of the officials signing them or whose facsimile signatures appear on the bonds has ceased to hold office at the time of such issue or at the time of the delivery of such bonds and refunding bonds to the purchaser.\n(l) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or of any bond act, bonds issued under this section may be sold at public sale on sealed proposals or, subject to the approval of the State Bond Commission, by negotiation, in such manner, at such price or prices, at such time or times and on such other terms and conditions as the Treasurer shall determine to be in the best interests of the state. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to general obligation bonds issued in accordance with sections 3-17 and 10-183m and delivered to the retirement fund provided for in section 10-183r or to refunding bonds sold at private sale pursuant to subsection (i) hereof.\n(m) With the exception of refunding bonds, whenever the State Bond Commission has adopted a resolution authorizing bonds, the Treasurer may, pending the issuing of such bonds, issue, in the name of the state, temporary notes and any renewals thereof in anticipation of the proceeds from the sale of such bonds, which notes and any renewals thereof shall be designated \u201cAnticipation Notes\u201d. The proceeds from the sale of such notes shall be used only for those purposes for which may be used the proceeds of the sale of bonds in anticipation whereof such anticipation notes were issued. Such portion of the proceeds from the sale of such bonds as may be required for such purposes shall be applied to the payment of the principal of and interest on any such anticipation notes which have been issued.\n(n) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any bonds sold under section 13a-208 or, except to the extent provided for in this section, to any bonds issued before or after July 1, 1953, pursuant to any bond act which took effect prior to said date.\n(o) Any bond act may adopt the provisions of this section by reference to this section or its short title and such reference shall serve to incorporate the provisions of this section in said bond act as though set out in full therein. Notwithstanding such adoption by reference, said bond act may contain provisions applicable to the bonds issued thereunder, and, in case of conflict, the provisions in such bond act shall prevail.\n(p) Bonds issued in accordance with the provisions of this section pursuant to any bond act are secured by the full faith and credit of the state, and as part of the contract of the state with the holders of said bonds, appropriation of all amounts necessary for punctual payment of principal of and interest on such bonds is hereby made and the Treasurer shall pay such principal and interest as the same become due.\n(q) The State Bond Commission shall have power from time to time to transfer funds from any project or purpose under any act to the contingency reserve of such act provided said commission shall have authorized such transfer upon a finding that there has been filed with it a request for such transfer which is signed by or on behalf of the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management stating that such projects or purposes have been completed and that such funds are excess moneys not needed for such project or purpose.\n(r) The State Bond Commission may make representations and agreements which are necessary or appropriate to ensure the exemption from taxation of interest on bonds, notes or other obligations of the state, eligibility of such bonds, notes or other obligations for tax credits or payments from the federal government, or any other desired federal income tax treatment of such bonds, notes or other obligations, in each case under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, including agreements to pay rebates to the federal government of investment earnings derived from the investment of the proceeds of bonds, notes or other obligations issued on or after January 1, 1986, or may delegate to the Treasurer the authority to make such representations and agreements on behalf of the state.

The State Bond Commission shall establish such rate or rates in order to achieve the goals and purposes of such loan programs, to achieve the best interests of the state and, to the extent deemed necessary or desirable by the State Bond Commission, to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, and regulations promulgated thereunder.\n(u) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or of any bond act, bonds, refunding bonds, notes or other obligations in anticipation thereof authorized and issued under this section may include contract provisions for (1) the payment of interest either (A) at certain rates in the event such interest is excludable from the gross income of the holders or owners thereof under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, or (B) at certain other rates in the event such interest is includable in the gross income of the holders or owners thereof under the Internal Revenue Service Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, (2) the payment by the state of such costs and expenses as may be incurred by the holders or owners of such obligations pursuant to the contract with the state as a result thereof, and (3) other terms as the Treasurer shall determine to be in the best interests of the state. As part of the contract of the state with the holders or owners of such obligations, appropriation of all such amounts necessary for the punctual payment of any amounts required to be paid pursuant to any such contract provisions is hereby made and the Treasurer shall pay such amounts as aforesaid as the same becomes due.\n(v) The State Bond Commission may make representations and agreements for the benefit of the holders of bonds, notes or other obligations of the state, or with respect to which the state is an obligated person, including bonds sold under section 13a-208, to provide secondary market disclosure information, or may delegate to the Treasurer the authority to make such representations and agreements on behalf of the state. Any such agreement may include: (1) Covenants to provide secondary market disclosure information, (2) arrangements for such information to be provided with the assistance of a paying agent, trustee or other agent, and (3) remedies for breach of such agreement, which remedies may be limited to specific performance. All such agreements entered into and all such actions taken prior to June 22, 1995, are hereby validated.\n(w) The state shall protect and save harmless any official or former official of the state from financial loss and expense, including legal fees and costs, if any, arising out of any claim, demand, suit or judgment by reason of alleged negligence on the part of such official, while acting in the discharge of his official duties, in providing secondary market disclosure information or performing any other duties set forth in any agreement to provide secondary market disclosure information. Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the defense of governmental immunity to any such claim, demand or suit. For purposes of this subsection \u201cofficial\u201d means any person elected or appointed to office or any state employee. This subsection shall not apply to cases of wilful and wanton fraud.\n(x) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes, public acts or special acts, upon any sale, lease or other disposition to or use by a nongovernmental entity of all or a portion of any project financed with proceeds of bonds of the state the interest on which is not included in gross income pursuant to Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, that would otherwise cause such bonds to be treated as private activity bonds within the meaning of Section 141 of said internal revenue code, the Treasurer is authorized to transfer all or a portion of the proceeds received with respect to and at the time of such disposition or use, in an amount not less than the amount required by said internal revenue code to preserve the exclusion from gross income of interest on such bonds, (1) to the General Fund to pay debt service on, including redemption, defeasance or purchase of, outstanding bonds of the state the interest on which is not included in gross income pursuant to Section 103 of said internal revenue code, (2) with the approval of the State Bond Commission, in lieu of the issuance of bonds, to the appropriate account or fund for any projects or purposes authorized by the State Bond Commission pursuant to a bond act and with the same force and effect as bond proceeds, thereby reducing the authority to issue bonds by such dollar amount, provided in any event that any such transfer does not cause the interest on the subject bonds to become included in gross income pursuant to Section 103 of said internal revenue code.\n(y) For the purposes of this subsection, \u201cstate moneys\u201d means the proceeds of the sale of bonds authorized pursuant to this section, or of temporary notes issued in anticipation of the moneys to be derived from the sale of such bonds. Each request filed for an authorization of bonds shall identify the project for which the proceeds of the sale of such bonds are to be used and, in addition to any terms and conditions required pursuant to this section, shall include the recommendation of the person signing such request as to the extent to which federal, private or other moneys then available or thereafter to be made available for costs in connection with any such project should be added to the state moneys available or becoming available for such project. If the request includes a recommendation that some amount of such federal, private or other moneys should be added to such state moneys, then, if and to the extent directed by the State Bond Commission at the time of authorization of such bonds, such amount of such federal, private or other moneys then available, or thereafter to be made available for costs in connection with such project, may be added to any state moneys available or becoming available for such project and shall be used for such project. Any other federal, private or other moneys then available or to be made available for costs in connection with such project shall, upon receipt, be used by the State Treasurer, in conformity with applicable federal and state law, to meet the principal of outstanding bonds issued pursuant to this section, or to meet the principal of temporary notes issued in anticipation of the money to be derived from the sale of bonds authorized pursuant to this section, for the purpose of financing such costs, either by purchase or redemption and cancellation of such bonds or notes, or by payment of such notes at maturity. Whenever any of the federal, private or other moneys so received with respect to such project are used to meet the principal of such temporary notes or whenever principal of any such temporary notes is retired by application of such federal, private or other moneys, the amounts of bonds authorized in anticipation of which such temporary notes were issued, and the aggregate amount of bonds which may be authorized, shall each be reduced by the amount of the principal so met or retired. Pending use of the federal, private or other moneys so received to meet principal as directed in this subsection, the amount of such moneys may be invested by the State Treasurer in bonds or obligation of, or guaranteed by, the state or the United States or agencies or instrumentalities of the United States, shall be deemed to be part of the debt retirement funds of the state, and net earnings on such investments shall be used in the same manner as the moneys so invested.\n(z) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes or any public act or special act, upon the request of any proposed recipient for a grant for a program or project within the state to be financed by bonds issued pursuant to this section, and subject to the approval of the State Bond Commission and the Treasurer, such grant may be made to a qualified community development entity, or to a partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or other business entity investing exclusively in a qualified community development entity, provided substantially all of the proceeds of such grant are made available to such proposed recipient to finance such project, or to any reinvestment in such project following a foreclosure brought against such proposed recipient or any affiliate of such proposed recipient on such project. For purposes of this subsection, \u201cqualified community development entity\u201d means an entity certified as a qualified community development entity pursuant to Section 45D(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time, that has received an allocation of new markets tax credits available for qualified low-income community investments in the state under Section 45D(f)(2) of said Internal Revenue Code.\n(aa) (1) For each fiscal year during which general obligation bonds or credit revenue bonds issued on and after May 15, 2018, and prior to July 1, 2020, shall be outstanding, the state of Connecticut shall comply with the provisions of (A) section 4-30a of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2017, as amended by section 704 of public act 17-2 of the June special session and section 7 of public act 18-49 and section 20 of public act 18-81, (B) section 2-33c in effect on October 31, 2017, (C) section 2-33a of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2017, as amended by section 709 of public act 17-2 of the June special session, (D) subsections (d) and (g) of this section, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2017, as amended by sections 710 and 711 of public act 17-2 of the June special session, and (E) section 3-21 of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2017, as amended by section 712 of public act 17-2 of the June special session. The state of Connecticut does hereby pledge to and agree with the holders of any bonds, notes and other obligations issued pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection that no public or special act of the General Assembly taking effect on or after May 15, 2018, and prior to July 1, 2023, shall alter the obligation to comply with the provisions of the sections and subsections set forth in subparagraphs (A) to (E), inclusive, of this subdivision, until such bonds, notes or other obligations, together with the interest thereon, are fully met and discharged, provided nothing in this subsection shall preclude such alteration (i) if and when adequate provision shall be made by law for the protection of the holders of such bonds, or (ii) (I) if and when the Governor declares an emergency or the existence of extraordinary circumstances, in which the provisions of section 4-85 are invoked, (II) at least three-fifths of the members of each chamber of the General Assembly vote to alter such required compliance during the fiscal year for which the emergency or existence of extraordinary circumstances are determined, and (III) any such alteration is for the fiscal year in progress only.\n(2) The Treasurer shall include this pledge and undertaking in general obligation bonds and credit revenue bonds issued on or after May 15, 2018, and prior to July 1, 2020, provided such pledge and undertaking (A) shall be applicable for a period of five years from the date of first issuance of such bonds, and (B) shall not apply to refunding bonds issued for bonds issued under this subdivision.\n(1953, 1955, June, 1955, S. 108d; 1959, P.A. 132, S. 13; 660, S. 1; 1961, P.A. 69; 1969, P.A. 629, S. 3; 1972, P.A. 85, S. 1; 243, S. 1; P.A. 73-4, S. 1, 2; P.A. 75-496, S. 1, 2; P.A. 76-349, S. 1, 3; P.A. 77-383, S. 1, 2; 77-614, S. 19, 73, 610; P.A. 78-208, S. 24, 25, 35; 78-331, S. 42, 58; 78-366, S. 1, 4; P.A. 79-31, S. 4, 17; 79-239, S. 8; 79-607, S. 4; 79-631, S. 49, 111; S.A. 80-41, S. 59, 68; P.A. 83-102, S. 1; June Sp.

The state of Connecticut does hereby pledge to and agree with the holders of any bonds, notes and other obligations issued pursuant to section 3-20h, that no public or special act of the General Assembly shall diminish any appropriation hereunder until such bonds, notes or other obligations, together with the interest thereon, are fully met and discharged, provided nothing herein contained shall preclude such diminishment if and when adequate provision shall be made by law for the protection of the holders of such bonds, or if and when the Governor declares an emergency or the existence of extraordinary circumstances, in which the provisions of section 4-85 are invoked, and at least three-fifths of the members of each chamber of the General Assembly vote to diminish such required appropriation during the fiscal year for which the emergency or existence of extraordinary circumstances are determined, or in such other circumstances as may be permitted by the terms of the bonds, notes or other obligations issued pursuant to section 3-20h.\n(b) The State of Connecticut does hereby pledge to and agree with the holders of any bonds, notes and other obligations issued pursuant to section 3-20h, that the state shall not treat the proceeds of any such bonds, notes or other obligations as constituting revenue of the General Fund, nor shall such proceeds be available for any current or future budget appropriation.\n(c) The State Treasurer is authorized to include these pledges and undertakings for the state in such bonds, notes or other obligations.\n(P.A. 13-239, S. 69.)\nHistory: P.A. 13-239 effective July 1, 2013."}

In no event shall the total of the principal amount of general obligation bonds and credit revenue bonds issued pursuant to the authority of any general statute or public or special act exceed the amount authorized thereunder. Except as provided for in this section, all provisions of section 3-20, except subsection (p) of said section, shall apply to such credit revenue bonds.\n(c) Bonds issued pursuant to this section shall be special obligations of the state and shall not be payable from or charged upon any funds other than the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged therefor, nor shall the state or any political subdivision thereof be subject to any liability thereon, except to the extent of such pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged therefor as provided in this section. As part of the contract of the state with the owners of such bonds, all amounts necessary for punctual payment of principal of and interest on such bonds, and redemption premium, if any, with respect to such bonds, is hereby appropriated and the Treasurer shall pay such principal and interest and redemption premium, if any, as the same shall become due but only from such sources. The issuance of bonds issued under this section shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the state or any political subdivision thereof to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor, except for taxes included in the pledged revenues, or to make any additional appropriation for their payment. Such bonds shall not constitute a charge, lien or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the state or of any political subdivision thereof other than the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged therefor as provided in this section, and the substance of such limitation shall be plainly stated on the face of each such bond and bond anticipation note.\n(d) The state hereby pledges all its right, title and interest to the pledged revenues to secure the due and punctual payment of the principal of and interest on the credit revenue bonds, and redemption premium, if any, with respect to such bonds. Such pledge shall secure all such credit revenue bonds equally, and such pledge is and shall be prior in interest to any other claim of any party to the pledged revenues, including any holder of general obligation bonds of the state. Such bonds also may be secured by a pledge of reserves, sinking funds and any other funds and accounts, including proceeds from investment of any of the foregoing, authorized hereby or by the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds, and by moneys paid under a credit facility including, but not limited to, a letter of credit or policy of bond insurance, issued by a financial institution pursuant to an agreement authorized by such proceedings.\n(e) The pledge of the pledged revenues under this section is made by the state by operation of law through this section, and as a statutory lien is effective without any further act or agreement by the state, and shall be valid and binding from the time the pledge is made, and any revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys so pledged and received by the state shall be subject immediately to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the state, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof.\n(f) In the proceedings authorizing any credit revenue bonds, the state shall direct the trustee to establish one or more collection accounts with the collection agent to receive the pledged revenues and shall direct payment of the pledged revenues into such collection accounts of the collection agent. Funds in such collection accounts shall be kept separate and apart from any other funds of the state until disbursed as provided for in the proceedings authorizing such credit revenue bonds. Such proceedings shall provide that no funds from such collection accounts shall be disbursed to the control of the state until and at such times as all current claims of any trustee set out in the proceedings have been satisfied, and thereafter may be disbursed to the control of the state free and clear of any claim by the trustee or the holders of any credit revenue bonds. The agreements with the depositaries establishing the collection accounts may provide for customary settlement terms for the collection of revenues. The expenses of the state in establishing such collection accounts and directing the deposit of pledged revenues therein, including the expenses of the Department of Revenue Services and the office of the Comptroller in establishing mechanisms to verify, allocate, track and audit such accounts and the deposits therein, may be paid as costs of issuance of any bonds issued pursuant to section 3-20 or this section.\n(g) The proceedings under which bonds are authorized to be issued, pursuant to this section, may, subject to the provisions of the general statutes, contain any or all of the following:\n(1) Covenants that confirm, as part of the contract with the holders of the credit revenue bonds, the agreements of the state set forth in subsections (d) to (f), inclusive, of this section;\n(2) Provisions for the execution of reimbursement agreements or similar agreements in connection with credit facilities including, but not limited to, letters of credit or policies of bond insurance, remarketing agreements and agreements for the purpose of moderating interest rate fluctuations, and of such other agreements entered into pursuant to section 3-20a;\n(3) Provisions for the collection, custody, investment, reinvestment and use of the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged therefor;\n(4) Provisions regarding the establishment and maintenance of reserves, sinking funds and any other funds and accounts as shall be approved by the State Bond Commission in such amounts as may be established by the State Bond Commission, and the regulation and disposition thereof, including requirements that any such funds and accounts be held separate from or not be commingled with other funds of the state;\n(5) Provisions for the issuance of additional bonds on a parity with bonds theretofore issued, including establishment of coverage requirements as a condition of the issuance of such additional bonds;\n(6) Provisions regarding the rights and remedies available in case of a default to the bondowners, or any trustee under any contract, loan agreement, document, instrument or trust indenture, including the right to appoint a trustee to represent their interests upon occurrence of an event of default, as defined in said proceedings, provided, if any bonds shall be secured by a trust indenture, the respective owners of such bonds or notes shall have no authority except as set forth in such trust indenture to appoint a separate trustee to represent them, and provided further no such right or remedy shall allow principal and interest on such bonds to be accelerated; and\n(7) Provisions or covenants of like or different character from the foregoing which are consistent with this and which the State Bond Commission determines in such proceedings are necessary, convenient or desirable to better secure the bonds, or will tend to make the bonds more marketable, and which are in the best interests of the state. Any provision which may be included in proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds hereunder may be included in a trust indenture duly approved in accordance with this subsection which secures the bonds and any notes issued in anticipation thereof, and in such case the provisions of such indenture shall be deemed to be a part of such proceedings as though they were expressly included therein.\n(h) Bonds issued pursuant to this section shall be secured by a trust indenture, approved by the State Bond Commission, by and between the state and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondowners as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the state in relation to the exercise of its powers pursuant to the pledged revenues and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. The state may provide by such trust indenture for the payment of the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys to the trustee under such trust indenture or to any other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine, but consistent with the provisions of subsections (d) to (f), inclusive, of this section.\n(i) The Treasurer shall have power to purchase bonds of the state issued pursuant to this section out of any funds available therefor. The Treasurer may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such bonds subject to and in accordance with agreements with bondowners.\n(j) Bonds issued pursuant to this section are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, whether or not such bonds are of such form and character as to be negotiable instruments under the terms of the Uniform Commercial Code, subject only to the provisions of such bonds for registration.\n(k) Any moneys held by the Treasurer or a trustee pursuant to a trust indenture with respect to bonds issued pursuant to this section, including pledged revenues, other pledged receipts, funds or moneys and proceeds from the sale of such bonds, may, pending the use or application of the proceeds thereof for an authorized purpose, be (1) invested and reinvested in such obligations, securities and investments as are set forth in subsection (f) of section 3-20 and in participation certificates in the Short Term Investment Fund created under section 3-27a, or (2) deposited or redeposited in such bank or banks as shall be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, the certificate of determination authorizing issuance of such bond anticipation notes or in the indenture securing such bonds. Proceeds from investments authorized by this subsection, less amounts required under the proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds, shall be credited to the General Fund.\n(l) Bonds issued pursuant to this section are hereby made securities in which all public officers and public bodies of the state and its political subdivisions, all insurance companies, credit unions, building and loan associations, investment companies, banking associations, trust companies, executors, administrators, trustees and other fiduciaries and pension, profit-sharing and retirement funds may properly and legally invest funds, including capital in their control or belonging to them. Such bonds are hereby made securities which may properly and legally be deposited with and received by any state or municipal officer or any agency or political subdivision of the state for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds or obligations of the state is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.\n(m) The state covenants with the purchasers and all subsequent owners and transferees of bonds issued by the state pursuant to this section, in consideration of the acceptance of the payment for the bonds, until such bonds, together with the interest thereon, with interest on any unpaid installment of interest and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding on behalf of such owners, are fully met and discharged, or unless expressly permitted or otherwise authorized by the terms of each contract and agreement made or entered into by or on behalf of the state with or for the benefit of such owners, that the state will impose, charge, raise, levy, collect and apply the pledged revenues and other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for the payment of debt service requirements as provided in this section, in such amounts as may be necessary to pay such debt service requirements in each year in which bonds are outstanding and further, that the state (1) will not limit or alter the duties imposed on the Treasurer and other officers of the state by law and by the proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds with respect to application of pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for the payment of debt service requirements as provided in said sections; (2) will not alter the provisions establishing collection accounts with the collection agent or the direction of pledged revenues to such collection accounts, or the provisions applying such pledged revenues to the debt service requirements with respect to bonds or notes; (3) will not issue any bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, other than the bonds, having any rights arising out of said sections or secured by any pledge of or other lien or charge on the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for the payment of debt service requirements as provided in said sections; (4) will not create or cause to be created any lien or charge on such pledged amounts, other than a lien or pledge created thereon pursuant to said sections, provided nothing in this subsection shall prevent the state from issuing evidences of indebtedness (A) which are secured by a pledge or lien which is and shall on the face thereof be expressly subordinate and junior in all respects to every lien and pledge created by or pursuant to said sections; (B) for which the full faith and credit of the state is pledged and which are not expressly secured by any specific lien or charge on such pledged amounts; or (C) which are secured by a pledge of or lien on moneys or funds derived on or after such date as every pledge or lien thereon created by or pursuant to said sections shall be discharged and satisfied; (5) will carry out and perform, or cause to be carried out and performed, every promise, covenant, agreement or contract made or entered into by the state or on its behalf with the owners of any bonds; (6) will not in any way impair the rights, exemptions or remedies of such owners; and (7) will not limit, modify, rescind, repeal or otherwise alter the rights or obligations of the appropriate officers of the state to impose, maintain, charge or collect the taxes, fees, charges and other receipts constituting the pledged revenues as may be necessary to produce sufficient revenues to fulfill the terms of the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds; and provided further the state may change the rate of withholding taxes, calculation of amounts to which the rate applies, including exemptions and deductions so long as any such change, had it been in effect, would not have reduced the withholding taxes for any twelve consecutive months within the preceding fifteen months to less than an amount three times the maximum debt service payable on bonds issued and outstanding under this section for the current or any future fiscal year. The State Bond Commission is authorized to include this covenant of the state in any agreement with the owner of any such bonds.\n(n) At the time of issuance of any credit revenue bonds pursuant to this section, the Treasurer shall determine the amount of principal and interest estimated to be saved by the issuance of credit revenue bonds instead of general obligation bonds, as measured by the difference between the stated principal and interest payable with respect to such credit revenue bonds in each fiscal year during which bonds shall be outstanding, and the principal and interest estimated to be payable in each fiscal year during which such bonds would have been outstanding had such bonds been issued as general obligation bonds payable over the same period on the basis of equal amounts of principal stated to be due in each fiscal year, subject to any specific adjustments which the Treasurer may consider appropriate to take into account in the structure for a specific bond issue, provided in any fiscal year that the Treasurer determines there are no savings, the estimated savings shall be zero for such fiscal year. The Treasurer shall base such determination on such factors as the Treasurer shall deem relevant, which may include advice from financial advisors to the state, historical trading patterns of outstanding state general obligation bonds and spreads to common municipal bond indexes. The Treasurer shall set out such estimated savings for each fiscal year during which each issue of credit revenue bonds shall be stated to be outstanding in a bond determination which shall be filed with the State Bond Commission at or prior to the issuance of such credit revenue bonds, and such amounts shall be dedicated savings for purposes of this section.\n(o) For each fiscal year during which credit revenue bonds shall be outstanding, there shall be transferred from the General Fund of the state to the Budget Reserve Fund established pursuant to section 4-30a, at the beginning of such fiscal year, an amount equal to the aggregate dedicated savings for all such bonds issued and to be outstanding in such fiscal year, unless the Governor declares an emergency or the existence of extraordinary circumstances, in which the provisions of section 4-85 are invoked, and at least three-fifths of the members of each chamber of the General Assembly vote to diminish such required transfer during the fiscal year for which the emergency or existence of extraordinary circumstances are determined, or in such other circumstances as may be permitted by the terms of the bonds, notes or other obligations issued pursuant to this section. Amounts so transferred shall not be available for appropriation for any other purpose, but shall only be used as provided in section 4-30a.\n(p) (1) Prior to July 1, 2023, net earnings of investments of proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to section 3-20 or pursuant to this section and accrued interest on the issuance of such bonds and premiums on the issuance of such bonds shall be deposited to the credit of the General Fund, after (A) payment of any expenses incurred by the Treasurer or State Bond Commission in connection with such issuance, or (B) application to interest on bonds, notes or other obligations of the state.\n(2) On and after July 1, 2023, notwithstanding subsection (f) of section 3-20, (A) net earnings of investments of proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to section 3-20 or pursuant to this section and accrued interest on the issuance of such bonds shall be deposited to the credit of the General Fund, and (B) premiums, net of any original issue discount, on the issuance of such bonds shall, after payment of any expenses incurred by the Treasurer or State Bond Commission in connection with such issuance, be deposited at the direction of the Treasurer to the credit of an account or fund to fund all or a portion of any purpose or project authorized by the State Bond Commission pursuant to any bond act up to the amount authorized by the State Bond Commission, provided the bonds for such purpose or project are unissued, and provided further the certificate of determination the Treasurer files with the secretary of the State Bond Commission for such authorized bonds sets forth the amount of the deposit applied to fund each such purpose and project. Upon such filing, the Treasurer shall record bonds in the amount of net premiums credited to each purpose and project as set forth in the certificate of determination of the Treasurer as deemed issued and retired and the Treasurer shall not thereafter exercise authority to issue bonds in such amount for such purpose or project. Upon such recording by the Treasurer, such bonds shall be deemed to have been issued, retired and no longer authorized for issuance or outstanding for the purposes of section 3-21, and for the purpose of aligning the funding of such authorized purpose and project with amounts generated by net premiums, but shall not constitute an actual bond issuance or bond retirement for any other purposes including, but not limited to, financial reporting purposes.\n(q) Any general obligation bonds or notes issued pursuant to section 3-20 may be refunded by credit revenue bonds or notes issued pursuant to this section, and any credit revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section may be refunded by general obligation bonds or notes issued pursuant to subsection (g) of section 3-20 in the manner, and subject to the same conditions, as set out in subsection (g) of section 3-20.\n(June Sp.

As part of the contract of the state with the owners of the abandoned property fund bonds, all amounts necessary for the punctual payment of the debt service requirements with respect to the abandoned property fund bonds shall be deemed appropriated, but only from the sources pledged pursuant to this section.\n(h) The abandoned property fund bonds may be issued if after authorization the Treasurer and the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management find that such issuance is necessary to disburse funds to the General Fund in support of state programs.\n(i) The abandoned property fund bonds may be executed and delivered at the time or times, shall be dated, shall bear interest at the rate or rates, shall mature at the time or times not exceeding seven years from their date, have the rank or priority, be payable in the medium of payment, be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, carry the registration and transfer privileges and be made redeemable before maturity at the price or prices and under the terms and conditions, all as may be provided by the proceedings and the Treasurer shall continue to deposit all abandoned property receipts in the Special Abandoned Property Fund to pay the abandoned property fund bonds until such bonds are fully discharged.\n(j) All of the provisions of section 3-20 with the exception of subsections (i) and (p) of said section 3-20 and the exercise of any right or power granted thereby which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, are hereby adopted and may be invoked in respect to the abandoned property fund bonds authorized pursuant to this section.\n(k) Any abandoned property fund bonds may be sold at public sale on sealed proposals or by negotiation in such manner, at such price or prices, at such time or times and on such other terms and conditions of such abandoned property fund bonds and the issuance and sale thereof as the Treasurer may determine to be in the best interests of the state.\n(l) The proceedings under which abandoned property fund bonds are authorized to be issued may, subject to the provisions of the general statutes, contain any or all of the following: (1) Provisions respecting custody of the proceeds from the sale of the abandoned property fund bonds, including any requirements that such proceeds be held separate from or not be commingled with other funds of the state; (2) provisions for the investment and reinvestment of abandoned property fund bond proceeds until used to pay Special Abandoned Property Fund financing costs and for the disposition of any excess bond proceeds or investment earnings thereon; (3) provisions for the execution of reimbursement agreements or similar agreements in connection with credit facilities, including, but not limited to, letters of credit or policies of bond insurance, remarketing agreements and agreements for the purpose of moderating interest rate fluctuations, and of such other agreements entered into pursuant to section 3-20a; (4) provisions for the collection, custody, investment, reinvestment and use of the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged therefor and deposited in the Special Abandoned Property Fund; (5) provisions regarding the establishment and maintenance of reserves, sinking funds and any other funds and accounts as shall be approved by the Treasurer in such amounts as may be established by the Treasurer, and the regulation and disposition thereof, including requirements that any such funds and accounts be held separate from or not be commingled with other funds of the state; (6) covenants for the establishment of pledged revenue coverage requirements for the abandoned property fund bonds; (7) provisions for the issuance of additional abandoned property fund bonds on a parity with abandoned property fund bonds theretofore issued, including establishment of coverage requirements with respect thereto as provided in this subsection; (8) provisions regarding the rights and remedies available in case of a default to the bondowners, or any trustee under any contract, document, instrument or indenture of trust, including the right to appoint a trustee to represent their interests upon occurrence of an event of default, as defined in said proceedings, provided if any abandoned property fund bonds shall be secured by an indenture of trust, the respective owners of such abandoned property fund bonds shall have no authority except as set forth in such trust indenture to appoint a separate trustee to represent them; and (9) provisions or covenants of like or different character from the foregoing which are determined in such proceedings are necessary, convenient or desirable in order to better secure the abandoned property fund bonds, or will tend to make the abandoned property fund bonds more marketable, and which are in the best interests of the state.\n(m) Any pledge made by the state pursuant to this section is and shall be deemed a statutory lien. Such lien shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made. The lien of any pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the state, including but not limited to a claim pursuant to sections 3-56a to 3-76, inclusive, irrespective of whether the parties have notice of the claims. Notwithstanding any provision of the Uniform Commercial Code, neither this section, the indenture of trust, the proceedings nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded. Any revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys so pledged and thereafter credited to and held in the Special Abandoned Property Fund shall be subject immediately to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act and such lien shall have priority over all other liens.\n(n) Abandoned property fund bonds may be secured by an indenture of trust by and between the state and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such indenture of trust may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondowners as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. The state may provide by such indenture of trust for the payment of the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys to the trustee under such indenture of trust or to any other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such indenture of trust may be treated as Special Abandoned Property Fund financing costs.\n(o) The Treasurer shall have power to purchase abandoned property fund bonds issued pursuant to this section out of any funds available therefor. The Treasurer may hold, pledge, cancel or resell such abandoned property fund bonds subject to and in accordance with agreements with bondowners.\n(p) Whether or not any abandoned property fund bonds issued pursuant to this section are of the form and character to qualify as negotiable instruments under the terms of title 42a, the abandoned property fund bonds are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all purposes of said title 42a, subject only to the provisions of the abandoned property fund bonds.\n(q) Any moneys held by the Treasurer or by a trustee pursuant to an indenture of trust with respect to abandoned property fund bonds including pledged revenues, other pledged receipts, funds or moneys and proceeds from the sale of such abandoned property fund bonds, may, pending the use or application of the proceeds thereof for an authorized purpose, be (1) invested and reinvested in such obligations, securities and investments as are set forth in subsection (f) of section 3-20, in participation certificates in the Short Term Investment Funds created under sections 3-27a and 3-27f and in participation certificates or securities of the Tax-Exempt Proceeds Fund created under section 3-24a or (2) deposited or redeposited in such bank or banks as shall be provided in the proceedings. Unless the proceedings provide otherwise, proceeds from investments authorized by this subsection, less amounts required under the proceedings authorizing the issuance of abandoned property fund bonds for the payment of Special Abandoned Property Fund financing costs relating to such abandoned property fund bonds, shall be credited to the Special Abandoned Property Fund.\n(r) Any abandoned property fund bonds at any time outstanding may, at any time and from time to time, be refunded by the state by the issuance of its refunding abandoned property fund bonds in such amounts as the Treasurer may deem necessary, but not to exceed an amount sufficient to refund the principal of the abandoned property fund bonds to be so refunded, to pay any unpaid interest on such abandoned property fund bonds and any premiums and commissions necessary to be paid in connection with such abandoned property fund bonds and to pay costs and expenses which the Treasurer may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the authorization, sale and issuance of refunding abandoned property fund bonds. Any such refunding may be effected whether the abandoned property fund bonds to be refunded shall have matured or shall thereafter mature. All refunding abandoned property fund bonds issued under this subsection shall be payable solely from the revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys out of which the abandoned property fund bonds to be refunded thereby are payable and shall be subject to and may be secured in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n(s) The state covenants with the purchasers and all subsequent owners and transferees of abandoned property fund bonds, in consideration of the acceptance of and payment for the abandoned property fund bonds, that the principal and interest of such abandoned property fund bonds shall be free from taxation at all times, except for estate and gift, franchise and excise taxes, imposed by the state or any political subdivision thereof. The Treasurer is authorized to include this covenant of the state in any agreement with the owner of any such abandoned property fund bonds.\n(t) Abandoned property fund bonds issued pursuant to this section are hereby made securities in which all public officers and public bodies of the state and its political subdivisions, all insurance companies, credit unions, building and loan associations, investment companies, banking associations, trust companies, executors, administrators, trustees and other fiduciaries and pension, profit-sharing and retirement funds may properly and legally invest funds, including capital in their control or belonging to them. Such abandoned property fund bonds are hereby made securities which may properly and legally be deposited with and received by any state or municipal officer or any agency or political subdivision of the state for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds or obligations of the state is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.\n(u) The state covenants with the purchasers and all subsequent owners and transferees of abandoned property fund bonds issued by the state pursuant to this section in consideration of the acceptance of the payment for the abandoned property fund bonds, until such abandoned property fund bonds, together with the interest thereon, with interest on any unpaid installment of interest and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding on behalf of such owners, are fully met and discharged, or unless expressly permitted or otherwise authorized by the terms of each contract and agreement made or entered into by or on behalf of the state with or for the benefit of such owners, that the state will apply the pledged revenues and other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for the payment of debt service requirements as provided in this section, in such amounts as may be necessary to pay such debt service requirements in each year in which such abandoned property fund bonds are outstanding and further, that the state (1) will not limit or alter the duties imposed on the Treasurer and other officers of the state by this section, and by the proceedings authorizing the issuance of abandoned property fund bonds with respect to application of pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for the payment of debt service requirements as provided in this section; (2) will not issue any bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, other than the abandoned property fund bonds, having any rights arising out of this section or secured by any pledge of or other lien or charge on the pledged revenues or other receipts, funds or moneys pledged for the payment of debt service requirements as provided in this section; (3) will not create or cause to be created any lien or charge on such pledged amounts, other than a lien or pledge created thereon pursuant to this section, provided nothing in this subsection shall prevent the state from issuing evidences of indebtedness (A) which are secured by a pledge or lien which is and shall on the face thereof be expressly subordinate and junior in all respects to every lien and pledge created by or pursuant to this section; or (B) for which the full faith and credit of the state is pledged and which are not expressly secured by any specific lien or charge on such pledged amounts; or (C) which are secured by a pledge of or lien on moneys or funds derived on or after such date as every pledge or lien thereon created by or pursuant to this section shall be discharged and satisfied; (4) will carry out and perform, or cause to be carried out and performed, each and every promise, covenant, agreement or contract made or entered into by the state or on its behalf with the owners of any abandoned property fund bonds; (5) will not in any way impair the rights, exemptions or remedies of the owners of abandoned property fund bonds; and (6) will not limit, modify, rescind, repeal or otherwise alter the rights or obligations of the appropriate officers of the state to collect the funds and other receipts constituting the pledged revenues as may be necessary to produce sufficient revenues to fulfill the terms of the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the abandoned property fund bonds, including pledged revenue coverage requirements, and provided, however, nothing in this subsection shall preclude the state from exercising its power to limit, modify, rescind, repeal or otherwise alter the character or amount of such pledged revenues, if and when adequate provisions shall be made by law for the protection of the owners of the outstanding abandoned property fund bonds. The Treasurer is authorized to include this covenant of the state in any agreement with the owners of any such abandoned property tax bonds.\n(P.A. 04-216, S. 56.)\nHistory: P.A. 04-216 effective May 6, 2004."}

Each report shall be verified and shall include: (1) The name, if known, and last-known address, if any, of each person appearing to be the owner of such property; (2) in case of unclaimed funds of an insurance company, the full name of the insured or annuitant and beneficiary and his or her last-known address appearing on the insurance company's records; (3) the nature and identifying number, if any, or description of the property and the amount appearing from the records to be due; (4) the date when the property became payable, demandable or returnable and the date of the last transaction with the owner with respect to the property; (5) if the holder is a successor to other holders, or if the holder has changed the holder's name, all prior known names and addresses of each holder of the property; and (6) such other information as the Treasurer may require.\n(c) Verification, if made by a partnership, shall be executed by a partner; if made by an unincorporated association or private corporation, by an officer; and if made by a public corporation, by its chief fiscal officer.\n(d) The Treasurer shall keep a permanent record of all reports submitted to the Treasurer pursuant to this section.\n(e) Except for claims paid under section 3-67a and except as provided in subsection (e) of section 3-70a, no owner shall be entitled to any interest, income or other increment which may accrue to property presumed abandoned from and after the date of payment or delivery to the Treasurer.\n(f) The Treasurer may decline to receive any property the value of which is less than the cost of giving notice or holding sale, or may postpone taking possession until a sufficient sum accumulates.\n(g) The Treasurer, or any officer or agency designated by the Treasurer, may examine any person on oath or affirmation, or the records of any person or any agent of the person including, but not limited to, a dividend disbursement agent or transfer agent of a business association, banking organization or insurance company that is the holder of property presumed abandoned to determine whether the person or agent has complied with this part. The Treasurer may conduct the examination even if the person or agent believes the person or agent is not in possession of any property that must be paid, delivered or reported under this part. The Treasurer may bring an action in a court of appropriate jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this part.\n(h) A record of the issuance of a check, draft or similar instrument is prima facie evidence of the obligation represented by the check, draft or similar instrument. In claiming property from a holder who is also the issuer, the Treasurer's burden of proof as to the existence and amount of the property and its abandonment is satisfied by showing issuance of the instrument and passage of the requisite period of abandonment. Defenses of payment, satisfaction, discharge and want of consideration are affirmative defenses that shall be established by the holder.\n(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the holder of personal property presumed abandoned pursuant to subdivision (5) of subsection (a) of section 3-57a shall (1) sell such property and pay the proceeds arising from such sale, excluding any charges that may lawfully be withheld, to the Treasurer, unless such property consists of military medals, in which case such property shall not be sold, and (2) provide the Treasurer with records deemed appropriate by the Treasurer of property so presumed abandoned. A holder of such property may contract with a third party to store and sell such property and to pay the proceeds arising from such sale, excluding any charges that may be lawfully withheld, to the Treasurer, provided the third party holds a surety bond or other form of insurance coverage with respect to such activities. Any holder who sells such property and remits the excess proceeds to the Treasurer or who transmits such property to a bonded or insured third party for such purposes, shall not be responsible for any claims related to the sale or transmission of the property or proceeds to the Treasurer. If the Treasurer exempts any such property from being remitted or sold pursuant to this subsection, whether by regulations or guidelines, the holder of such property may dispose of such property in any manner such holder deems appropriate and such holder shall not be responsible for any claims related to the disposition of such property or any claims to the property itself. For purposes of this subsection, charges that may lawfully be withheld include costs of storage, appraisal, advertising and sales commissions as well as lawful charges owing under the contract governing the safe deposit box rental.\n(j) In the event military medals are presumed abandoned pursuant to subdivision (5) of subsection (a) of section 3-57a, a banking or financial organization shall transmit such medals to the Department of Veterans Affairs in accordance with procedures established by the Treasurer. The Treasurer and Commissioner of Veterans Affairs shall enter into a memorandum of understanding concerning the handling of such medals and the Department of Veterans Affairs shall hold such medals in custody pursuant to such memorandum.
