The petition shall include affidavits that demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the board, both of the following:\n(1)\u00a0The licentiate has engaged in acts or omissions constituting a violation of this code or has been convicted of a crime substantially related to the licensed activity.\n(2)\u00a0Permitting the licentiate to continue to engage in the licensed activity, or permitting the licentiate to continue in the licensed activity without restrictions, would endanger the public health, safety, or welfare.\n(b)\u00a0No interim order provided for in this section shall be issued without notice to the licentiate unless it appears from the petition and supporting documents that serious injury would result to the public before the matter could be heard on notice.\n(c)\u00a0Except as provided in subdivision (b), the licentiate shall be given at least 15 days\u2019 notice of the hearing on the petition for an interim order. The notice shall include documents submitted to the board in support of the petition. If the order was initially issued without notice as provided in subdivision (b), the licentiate shall be entitled to a hearing on the petition within 20 days of the issuance of the interim order without notice. The licentiate shall be given notice of the hearing within two days after issuance of the initial interim order, and shall receive all documents in support of the petition. The failure of the board to provide a hearing within 20 days following the issuance of the interim order without notice, unless the licentiate waives his or her right to the hearing, shall result in the dissolution of the interim order by operation of law.\n(d)\u00a0At the hearing on the petition for an interim order, the licentiate may:\n(1)\u00a0Be represented by counsel.\n(2)\u00a0Have a record made of the proceedings, copies of which shall be available to the licentiate upon payment of costs computed in accordance with the provisions for transcript costs for judicial review contained in Section 11523 of the Government Code.\n(3)\u00a0Present affidavits and other documentary evidence.\n(4)\u00a0Present oral argument.\n(e)\u00a0The board, or an administrative law judge sitting alone as provided in subdivision (h), shall issue a decision on the petition for interim order within five business days following submission of the matter.

The board shall exercise all other powers relating to the conduct of the hearing but may delegate any or all of them to the administrative law judge. When the petition has been delegated to an administrative law judge, he or she shall sit alone and exercise all of the powers of the board relating to the conduct of the hearing. A decision issued by an administrative law judge sitting alone shall be final when it is filed with the board. If the administrative law judge issues an interim order without notice, he or she shall preside at the noticed hearing, unless unavailable, in which case another administrative law judge may hear the matter. The decision of the administrative law judge sitting alone on the petition for an interim order is final, subject only to judicial review in accordance with subdivision (g).\n(i)\u00a0Failure to comply with an interim order issued pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) shall constitute a separate cause for disciplinary action against any licentiate, and may be heard at, and as a part of, the noticed hearing provided for in subdivision (f). Allegations of noncompliance with the interim order may be filed at any time prior to the rendering of a decision on the accusation. Violation of the interim order is established upon proof that the licentiate was on notice of the interim order and its terms, and that the order was in effect at the time of the violation. The finding of a violation of an interim order made at the hearing on the accusation shall be reviewed as a part of any review of a final decision of the agency.\nIf the interim order issued by the agency provides for anything less than a complete suspension of the licentiate from his or her business or profession, and the licentiate violates the interim order prior to the hearing on the accusation provided for in subdivision (f), the agency may, upon notice to the licentiate and proof of violation, modify or expand the interim order.\n(j)\u00a0A plea or verdict of guilty or a conviction after a plea of nolo contendere is deemed to be a conviction within the meaning of this section. A certified record of the conviction shall be conclusive evidence of the fact that the conviction occurred. A board may take action under this section notwithstanding the fact that an appeal of the conviction may be taken.\n(k)\u00a0The interim orders provided for by this section shall be in addition to, and not a limitation on, the authority to seek injunctive relief provided in any other provision of law.\n(l)\u00a0In the case of a board, a petition for an interim order may be filed by the executive officer.

The State Board of Equalization and the Franchise Tax Board may, when it is economically feasible for the state governmental licensing entity to develop an automated process for complying with this subdivision, notify the state governmental licensing entity in a manner prescribed by the State Board of Equalization or the Franchise Tax Board, whichever is applicable, that the licensee has not complied with the installment payment agreement. Upon receipt of this notice, the state governmental licensing entity shall immediately notify the licensee on a form prescribed by the state governmental licensing entity that the licensee\u2019s license will be suspended on a specific date, and this date shall be no longer than 30 days from the date the form is mailed.

Fees imposed pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the fund in which other fees imposed by the state governmental licensing entity are deposited and shall be available to that entity upon appropriation in the annual Budget Act.\n(m)\u00a0The process described in subdivision (h) shall constitute the sole administrative remedy for contesting the issuance of a temporary license or the denial or suspension of a license under this section.\n(n)\u00a0Any state governmental licensing entity receiving an inquiry as to the licensed status of an applicant or licensee who has had a license denied or suspended under this section or who has been granted a temporary license under this section shall respond that the license was denied or suspended or the temporary license was issued only because the licensee appeared on a list of the 500 largest tax delinquencies pursuant to Section 7063 or 19195 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. Information collected pursuant to this section by any state agency, board, or department shall be subject to the Information Practices Act of 1977 (Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 1798) of Title 1.8 of Part 4 of Division 3 of the Civil Code). Any state governmental licensing entity that discloses on its internet website or other publication that the licensee has had a license denied or suspended under this section or has been granted a temporary license under this section shall prominently disclose, in bold and adjacent to the information regarding the status of the license, that the only reason the license was denied, suspended, or temporarily issued is because the licensee failed to pay taxes.\n(o)\u00a0Any rules and regulations issued pursuant to this section by any state agency, board, or department may be adopted as emergency regulations in accordance with the rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).

The release or other use of information received by a state governmental licensing entity pursuant to this section, except as authorized by this section, is punishable as a misdemeanor. This subdivision may not be interpreted to prevent the State Bar of California from filing a request with the Supreme Court of California to suspend a member of the bar pursuant to this section.\n(2)\u00a0A suspension of, or refusal to renew, a license or issuance of a temporary license pursuant to this section does not constitute denial or discipline of a licensee for purposes of any reporting requirements to the National Practitioner Data Bank and shall not be reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank or the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank.\n(3)\u00a0Upon release from the certified list, the suspension or revocation of the applicant\u2019s or licensee\u2019s license shall be purged from the state governmental licensing entity\u2019s internet website or other publication within three business days.

For purposes of this paragraph, a payor is deemed to have actively encouraged its beneficiaries to use the list of contracted providers if one of the following occurs:\n(A)\u00a0The payor\u2019s contract with subscribers or insureds offers beneficiaries direct financial incentives to use the list of contracted providers when obtaining medical care. \u201cFinancial incentives\u201d means reduced copayments, reduced deductibles, premium discounts directly attributable to the use of a provider panel, or financial penalties directly attributable to the nonuse of a provider panel.\n(B)\u00a0The payor provides information directly to its beneficiaries, who are parties to the contract, or, in the case of workers\u2019 compensation insurance, the employer, advising them of the existence of the list of contracted providers through the use of a variety of advertising or marketing approaches that supply the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of contracted providers to beneficiaries in advance of their selection of a health care provider, which approaches may include, but are not limited to, the use of provider directories, or the use of toll-free telephone numbers or internet web site addresses supplied directly to every beneficiary. However, internet web site addresses alone shall not be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph. Nothing in this subparagraph shall prevent contracting agents or payors from providing only listings of providers located within a reasonable geographic range of a beneficiary.\n(3)\u00a0Disclose whether payors to which the list of contracted providers may be sold, leased, transferred, or conveyed may be permitted to pay a provider\u2019s contracted rate without actively encouraging the payors\u2019 beneficiaries to use the list of contracted providers when obtaining medical care. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to require a payor to actively encourage the payor\u2019s beneficiaries to use the list of contracted providers when obtaining medical care in the case of an emergency.\n(4)\u00a0Disclose, upon the initial signing of a contract, and within 30 calendar days of receipt of a written request from a provider or provider panel, a payor summary of all payors currently eligible to claim a provider\u2019s contracted rate due to the provider\u2019s and payor\u2019s respective written agreements with any contracting agent.\n(5)\u00a0Allow providers, upon the initial signing, renewal, or amendment of a provider contract, to decline to be included in any list of contracted providers that is sold, leased, transferred, or conveyed to payors that do not actively encourage the payors\u2019 beneficiaries to use the list of contracted providers when obtaining medical care as described in paragraph (2). Each provider\u2019s election under this paragraph shall be binding on the contracting agent with which the provider has the contract and on any other contracting agent that buys, leases, or otherwise obtains the list of contracted providers.

This notice obligation shall not affect the ability of either party to terminate the lease pursuant to this section. The landlord may not interfere with an outgoing optometrist\u2019s efforts to inform the optometrist\u2019s patients, in accordance with customary practice and professional obligations, of the relocation of the optometrist\u2019s practice.\n(15)\u00a0The California State Board of Optometry may inspect, upon request, an individual lease agreement pursuant to its investigational authority, and if such a request is made, the landlord or tenant, as applicable, shall promptly comply with the request.

Where a citation is not contested and a fine is not paid, the full amount of the assessed fine shall be added to the fee for renewal of the license. A license shall not be renewed without payment of the renewal fee and fine.\n(5)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other law, if a fine is paid to satisfy an assessment based on the finding of a violation, payment of the fine shall be represented as satisfactory resolution of the matter for purposes of public disclosure.\n(i)\u00a0Administrative fines collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the fund of the board that has issued the fine.

(a)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other law, the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, and the Physician Assistant Board shall disclose to an inquiring member of the public information regarding any enforcement actions taken against a licensee, including a former licensee, by the board or by another state or jurisdiction, including all of the following:\n(1)\u00a0Temporary restraining orders issued.\n(2)\u00a0Interim suspension orders issued.\n(3)\u00a0Revocations, suspensions, probations, or limitations on practice ordered by the board, including those made part of a probationary order or stipulated agreement.\n(4)\u00a0Public letters of reprimand issued.\n(5)\u00a0Infractions, citations, or fines imposed.\n(b)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other law, in addition to the information provided in subdivision (a), the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, and the Physician Assistant Board shall disclose to an inquiring member of the public all of the following:\n(1)\u00a0Civil judgments in any amount, whether or not vacated by a settlement after entry of the judgment, that were not reversed on appeal and arbitration awards in any amount of a claim or action for damages for death or personal injury caused by the licensee\u2019s negligence, error, or omission in practice, or by rendering unauthorized professional services.\n(2)\u00a0(A)\u00a0All settlements in the possession, custody, or control of the board shall be disclosed for a licensee in the low-risk category if there are three or more settlements for that licensee within the last 10 years, except for settlements by a licensee regardless of the amount paid where (i) the settlement is made as a part of the settlement of a class claim, (ii) the licensee paid in settlement of the class claim the same amount as the other licensees in the same class or similarly situated licensees in the same class, and (iii) the settlement was paid in the context of a case where the complaint that alleged class liability on behalf of the licensee also alleged a products liability class action cause of action. All settlements in the possession, custody, or control of the board shall be disclosed for a licensee in the high-risk category if there are four or more settlements for that licensee within the last 10 years except for settlements by a licensee regardless of the amount paid where (i) the settlement is made as a part of the settlement of a class claim, (ii) the licensee paid in settlement of the class claim the same amount as the other licensees in the same class or similarly situated licensees in the same class, and (iii) the settlement was paid in the context of a case where the complaint that alleged class liability on behalf of the licensee also alleged a products liability class action cause of action. Classification of a licensee in either a \u201chigh-risk category\u201d or a \u201clow-risk category\u201d depends upon the specialty or subspecialty practiced by the licensee and the designation assigned to that specialty or subspecialty by the Medical Board of California, as described in subdivision (f). For the purposes of this paragraph, \u201csettlement\u201d means a settlement of an action described in paragraph (1) entered into by the licensee on or after January 1, 2003, in an amount of thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) or more.\n(B)\u00a0The board shall not disclose the actual dollar amount of a settlement but shall put the number and amount of the settlement in context by doing the following:\n(i)\u00a0Comparing the settlement amount to the experience of other licensees within the same specialty or subspecialty, indicating if it is below average, average, or above average for the most recent 10-year period.\n(ii)\u00a0Reporting the number of years the licensee has been in practice.\n(iii)\u00a0Reporting the total number of licensees in that specialty or subspecialty, the number of those who have entered into a settlement agreement, and the percentage that number represents of the total number of licensees in the specialty or subspecialty.\n(3)\u00a0Current American Board of Medical Specialties certification or board equivalent as certified by the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, or the California Board of Podiatric Medicine.\n(4)\u00a0Approved postgraduate training.\n(5)\u00a0Status of the license of a licensee. By January 1, 2004, the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, and the California Board of Podiatric Medicine shall adopt regulations defining the status of a licensee. The board shall employ this definition when disclosing the status of a licensee pursuant to Section 2027.\n(6)\u00a0Any summaries of hospital disciplinary actions that result in the termination or revocation of a licensee\u2019s staff privileges for medical disciplinary cause or reason, unless a court finds, in a final judgment, that the peer review resulting in the disciplinary action was conducted in bad faith and the licensee notifies the board of that finding. In addition, any exculpatory or explanatory statements submitted by the licentiate electronically pursuant to subdivision (f) of Section 805 shall be disclosed. For purposes of this paragraph, \u201cpeer review\u201d has the same meaning as defined in Section 805.\n(c)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other law, the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, and the Physician Assistant Board shall disclose to an inquiring member of the public information received regarding felony convictions of a licensee.\n(d)\u00a0The Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, and the Physician Assistant Board may formulate appropriate disclaimers or explanatory statements to be included with any information released, and may by regulation establish categories of information that need not be disclosed to an inquiring member of the public because that information is unreliable or not sufficiently related to the licensee\u2019s professional practice. The Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, and the Physician Assistant Board shall include the following statement when disclosing information concerning a settlement:\n\u201cSome studies have shown that there is no significant correlation between malpractice history and a licensee\u2019s competence. At the same time, the State of California believes that consumers should have access to malpractice information. In these profiles, the State of California has given you information about both the malpractice settlement history for the licensee\u2019s specialty and the licensee\u2019s history of settlement payments only if in the last 10 years, the licensee, if in a low-risk specialty, has three or more settlements or the licensee, if in a high-risk specialty, has four or more settlements. The State of California has excluded some class action lawsuits because those cases are commonly related to systems issues such as product liability, rather than questions of individual professional competence and because they are brought on a class basis where the economic incentive for settlement is great. The State of California has placed payment amounts into three statistical categories: below average, average, and above average compared to others in the licensee\u2019s specialty. To make the best health care decisions, you should view this information in perspective. You could miss an opportunity for high-quality care by selecting a licensee based solely on malpractice history.\nWhen considering malpractice data, please keep in mind:\nMalpractice histories tend to vary by specialty. Some specialties are more likely than others to be the subject of litigation. This report compares licensees only to the members of their specialty, not to all licensees, in order to make an individual licensee\u2019s history more meaningful.\nThis report reflects data only for settlements made on or after January 1, 2003. Moreover, it includes information concerning those settlements for a 10-year period only. Therefore, you should know that a licensee may have made settlements in the 10 years immediately preceding January 1, 2003, that are not included in this report. After January 1, 2013, for licensees practicing less than 10 years, the data covers their total years of practice. You should take into account the effective date of settlement disclosure as well as how long the licensee has been in practice when considering malpractice averages.\nThe incident causing the malpractice claim may have happened years before a payment is finally made. Sometimes, it takes a long time for a malpractice lawsuit to settle. Some licensees work primarily with high-risk patients. These licensees may have malpractice settlement histories that are higher than average because they specialize in cases or patients who are at very high risk for problems.\nSettlement of a claim may occur for a variety of reasons that do not necessarily reflect negatively on the professional competence or conduct of the licensee. A payment in settlement of a medical malpractice action or claim should not be construed as creating a presumption that medical malpractice has occurred.\nYou may wish to discuss information in this report and the general issue of malpractice with the licensee.\u201d\n(e)\u00a0The Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, and the Physician Assistant Board shall, by regulation, develop standard terminology that accurately describes the different types of disciplinary filings and actions to take against a licensee as described in paragraphs (1) to (5), inclusive, of subdivision (a). In providing the public with information about a licensee via the internet pursuant to Section 2027, the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, and the Physician Assistant Board shall not use the terms \u201cenforcement,\u201d \u201cdiscipline,\u201d or similar language implying a sanction unless the licensee has been the subject of one of the actions described in paragraphs (1) to (5), inclusive, of subdivision (a).\n(f)\u00a0The Medical Board of California shall adopt regulations no later than July 1, 2003, designating each specialty and subspecialty practice area as either high risk or low risk. In promulgating these regulations, the board shall consult with commercial underwriters of medical malpractice insurance companies, health care systems that self-insure physicians and surgeons, and representatives of the California medical specialty societies. The board shall utilize the carriers\u2019 statewide data to establish the two risk categories and the averages required by subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b). Prior to issuing regulations, the board shall convene public meetings with the medical malpractice carriers, self-insurers, and specialty representatives.\n(g)\u00a0The Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, and the Physician Assistant Board shall provide each licensee, including a former licensee under subdivision (a), with a copy of the text of any proposed public disclosure authorized by this section prior to release of the disclosure to the public. The licensee shall have 10 working days from the date the board provides the copy of the proposed public disclosure to propose corrections of factual inaccuracies. Nothing in this section shall prevent the board from disclosing information to the public prior to the expiration of the 10-day period.\n(h)\u00a0Pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b), the specialty or subspecialty information required by this section shall group licensees by specialty board recognized pursuant to paragraph (5) of subdivision (h) of Section 651 unless a different grouping would be more valid and the board, in its statement of reasons for its regulations, explains why the validity of the grouping would be more valid.\n(Amended by Stats. 2019, Ch. 456, Sec. 1.

(a)\u00a0The Legislature hereby finds and declares the following:\n(1)\u00a0In 1986, Congress enacted the federal Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 11101 et seq.), to encourage physicians and surgeons to engage in effective professional peer review, but giving each state the opportunity to \u201copt-out\u201d of some of the provisions of the federal act.\n(2)\u00a0Because of deficiencies in the federal act and the possible adverse interpretations by the courts of the federal act, it is preferable for California to \u201copt-out\u201d of the federal act and design its own peer review system.\n(3)\u00a0Peer review, fairly conducted, is essential to preserving the highest standards of medical practice.\n(4)\u00a0Peer review that is not conducted fairly results in harm to both patients and healing arts practitioners by limiting access to care.\n(5)\u00a0Peer review, fairly conducted, will aid the appropriate state licensing boards in their responsibility to regulate and discipline errant healing arts practitioners.\n(6)\u00a0To protect the health and welfare of the people of California, it is the policy of the State of California to exclude, through the peer review mechanism as provided for by California law, those healing arts practitioners who provide substandard care or who engage in professional misconduct, regardless of the effect of that exclusion on competition.\n(7)\u00a0It is the intent of the Legislature that peer review of professional health care services be done efficiently, on an ongoing basis, and with an emphasis on early detection of potential quality problems and resolutions through informal educational interventions.\n(8)\u00a0Sections 809 to 809.8, inclusive, shall not affect the respective responsibilities of the organized medical staff or the governing body of an acute care hospital with respect to peer review in the acute care hospital setting. It is the intent of the Legislature that written provisions implementing Sections 809 to 809.8, inclusive, in the acute care hospital setting shall be included in medical staff bylaws that shall be adopted by a vote of the members of the organized medical staff and shall be subject to governing body approval, which approval shall not be withheld unreasonably.\n(9)\u00a0(A)\u00a0The Legislature thus finds and declares that the laws of this state pertaining to the peer review of healing arts practitioners shall apply in lieu of Section 11101 and following of Title 42 of the United States Code, because the laws of this state provide a more careful articulation of the protections for both those undertaking peer review activity and those subject to review, and better integrate public and private systems of peer review. Therefore, California exercises its right to opt out of specified provisions of the federal Health Care Quality Improvement Act relating to professional review actions, pursuant to Section 11111(c)(2)(B) of Title 42 of the United States Code. This election shall not affect the availability of any immunity under California law.\n(B)\u00a0The Legislature further declares that it is not the intent or purpose of Sections 809 to 809.8, inclusive, to opt out of any mandatory national data bank established pursuant to Section 11131 and following of Title 42 of the United States Code.\n(b)\u00a0For the purpose of this section and Sections 809.1 to 809.8, inclusive, \u201chealing arts practitioner\u201d or \u201clicentiate\u201d means a physician and surgeon, podiatrist, clinical psychologist, marriage and family therapist, clinical social worker, professional clinical counselor, or dentist; and \u201cpeer review body\u201d means a peer review body as specified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 805, and includes any designee of the peer review body.\n(Amended by Stats. 2011, Ch. 381, Sec. 10.

The failure by either party to provide access to this information at least 30 days before the hearing shall constitute good cause for a continuance. The right to inspect and copy by either party does not extend to confidential information referring solely to individually identifiable licentiates, other than the licentiate under review. The arbitrator or presiding officer shall consider and rule upon any request for access to information, and may impose any safeguards the protection of the peer review process and justice requires.\n(e)\u00a0When ruling upon requests for access to information and determining the relevancy thereof, the arbitrator or presiding officer shall, among other factors, consider the following:\n(1)\u00a0Whether the information sought may be introduced to support or defend the charges.\n(2)\u00a0The exculpatory or inculpatory nature of the information sought, if any.\n(3)\u00a0The burden imposed on the party in possession of the information sought, if access is granted.\n(4)\u00a0Any previous requests for access to information submitted or resisted by the parties to the same proceeding.\n(f)\u00a0At the request of either side, the parties shall exchange lists of witnesses expected to testify and copies of all documents expected to be introduced at the hearing. Failure to disclose the identity of a witness or produce copies of all documents expected to be produced at least 10 days before the commencement of the hearing shall constitute good cause for a continuance.\n(g)\u00a0Continuances shall be granted upon agreement of the parties or by the arbitrator or presiding officer on a showing of good cause.\n(h)\u00a0A hearing under this section shall be commenced within 60 days after receipt of the request for hearing, and the peer review process shall be completed within a reasonable time, after a licentiate receives notice of a final proposed action or an immediate suspension or restriction of clinical privileges, unless the arbitrator or presiding officer issues a written decision finding that the licentiate failed to comply with subdivisions (d) and (e) in a timely manner, or consented to the delay.\n(Added by Stats. 1989, Ch. 336, Sec. 3.

The Legislature further finds that inspections are the most effective means of furthering this policy. It is not the intent of the Legislature to reduce in any way the resources available to the department for inspections, but rather to provide the department with the greatest flexibility to concentrate its resources where they can be most effective. It is the intent of the Legislature to provide for an inspection process that includes state-based inspection components and that determines compliance with federal and state requirements for clinical laboratories.\n(b)\u00a0The department shall employ, or contract for, inspectors, special agents, and investigators, and provide any clerical and technical assistance as necessary to administer this chapter and may incur other expenses as necessary.\n(c)\u00a0Laboratories accredited by a private, nonprofit organization shall be deemed by the department to meet state licensure or registration requirements, and shall be issued a certificate of that deemed status by the department, provided that both of the following conditions are met:\n(1)\u00a0The private, nonprofit organization meets all of the following requirements:\n(A)\u00a0Is approved by the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services as an accreditation body under CLIA and provides the department with the following information:\n(i)\u00a0A detailed comparison of the individual accreditation or approval requirements, with the comparable condition-level requirements.\n(ii)\u00a0A detailed description of its inspection process, including all of the following:\n(I)\u00a0Frequency of inspections.\n(II)\u00a0Copies of inspection forms.\n(III)\u00a0Instructions and guidelines.\n(IV)\u00a0A description of the review and decisionmaking process of inspections.\n(V)\u00a0A statement concerning whether inspections are announced or unannounced.\n(VI)\u00a0A description of the steps taken to monitor the correction of deficiencies.\n(iii)\u00a0A description of the process for monitoring proficiency testing performance, including action to be taken in response to unsuccessful participation.\n(iv)\u00a0A list of all of its current California licensed or registered laboratories and the expiration date of their accreditation, licensure, or registration, as applicable.\n(B)\u00a0Is approved by the department as having accreditation standards that are equal to, or more stringent than, state requirements for licensure and registration.\n(C)\u00a0Conducts inspections of clinical laboratories in a manner that will determine compliance with federal standards and California laws to the extent that California laws provide greater protection to residents, or are more stringent than federal standards, as determined by the department.

The department shall post the ACLL on its Internet Web site so that any person may observe which California laws are more stringent than federal standards, and which accreditation bodies have been approved to conduct inspections. Public comment on the ACLL shall be accepted by the department for 30 days after posting and shall become final 45 days after the posting. Comments received shall be considered by the department.

Except as authorized under subdivision (f), the department shall not conduct routine inspections of a laboratory issued a certificate of deemed status pursuant to subdivision (c). Each application for a certificate of deemed status issued under subdivision (c) and each request for renewal of that certificate shall be accompanied by the fees set forth in Section 1300. The total of those certificate application and renewal fees collected by the department shall be sufficient to cover the cost of issuing the certificate. If the department determines that those certificate fees do not fully support the costs of these activities, it shall report that determination to the Legislature.\n(f)\u00a0Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the exercise of the department\u2019s authority to conduct complaint investigations, sample validation inspections, or require submission of proficiency testing results to the department to ensure compliance of any clinical laboratory with state standards.\n(Amended by Stats. 2009, Ch. 201, Sec. 2.
